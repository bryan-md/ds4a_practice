On 1 March 2021, 5,455 new cases and 104 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported across the UK.

A total of 20,275,451 people have now received the first dose of a #vaccine. https://t.co/2lvKyVRGYhBLAZE1 phase2 of LyCOV555 was published @NEJM https://t.co/U4UYLif5oA
It randomized 452 outpatients w/ COVID19 to 1 of 3 doses of Ab vs placebo
Treatment was associated w/ shorter duration of viremia &amp; lower risk of hospitalization, w/o safety signals
But...

WTF science is this?@OliverStrawhat @BmoreBaker42 @jemillerwbal @MayorBMScott Ok, and while that is valid - it‚Äôs a moot point. While the pandemic response in general is lacking, I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs targeting African-Americans in Baltimore. If I was still a Marylander I would wonder why PG County has only a 7% vax rate, a clear outlier https://t.co/g2um7IyykK@BrandonRichards @JessOConnell I‚Äôll be traveling and I am still planning to take all of the same precautions I did pre-vaccination to protect the people around me. But this article also says data suggests vaccinated people are less likely to spread the virus. https://t.co/GSJnNMLxHS@ShanaVWhite My governor stated today he‚Äôs lowering the age range to include those 50 and higher...teachers in that age group will qualify then...still not me though. 

This selective vaccination stuff is ridiculous!Monday 1 March ‚Äì coronavirus cases in Queensland:

Sadly, six Queenslanders with COVID-19 have died. 1,313 patients have recovered.

#covid19 https://t.co/H5o4yuDfFK@TimHoustonNS Quit trying to fill our heads with common sense @TimHoustonNS. Everybody knows that the virus only spreads from 9-5 on weekdays. We need to save those 29,000 vaccine doses that have been lingering on the shelves for a rainy day.

This doesn't make them safe and if I or my loved ones had MS I'd damn sure want to know. Yet would I be told?
https://t.co/S0LJcvqrjIFrom the moderna website. I hate to feel like a guinea pig #COVID19 https://t.co/kAcQFjeSqYIt seems to me that now is the time for @UKLabour to accept @Keir_Starmer is not the leader this party needs. With all the Tory blunders during the #coronavirus - Labour should be miles ahead in the polls, but we're losing members daily.

#StarmerOut
Call a leadership election!@SebastianEPayne Dont get me wrong but the numbers don‚Äôt add up?

Adult population = 58m
94% = 54.5m
Leaves 3.5m

4.1m have had the virus so therefore will have proven T Cell immunity &amp; will not require vaccination.
