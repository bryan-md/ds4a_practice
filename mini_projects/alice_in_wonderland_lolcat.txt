CHAPTER I.
Doezwn teh Rabbit-Hole


Alice wuz beesginning 2 git vary tired ov sitting by her sizter on teh
bank, an ov havin no2h haing 2 doez: once or twice she had peeped in2
teh bok her sizter wuz readin, but it had no picturez or
conversashuns in it, “an wut iz teh use ov bok,” thot Alice
“wifout picturez or conversashuns?”

So she wuz considring in her own mind (as well as she cud, 4 teh
hot dai made her feelz vary sleepy an stupid), whethr teh pleasure ov
makin daizy-chain wud bees wurth teh trouble ov gitting up an
pickin teh daizies, when suddenly Woh haite Rabbit wif pink eyez ran
close by her.

Tehr wuz notoh haing so _vary_ remarkable in dat; nor did Alice toh haink it
so _vary_ mutch out ov teh wai 2 hear teh Rabbit sai 2 itzelf, “O
dear! O dear! I shall bees late!” (when she thot it ovar aftrwards,
it occurred 2 her dat she ought 2 has wondred at 2h haiz, but at teh
tiem it all cmed quite natural); but when teh Rabbit akshully _2k a
watch out ov itz waiztcoat-pocket_, an lokd at it, an tehn hurried
on, Alice startd 2 her feet, 4 it flashed acros her mind dat she
had nevr bees4e cn rabbit wif eithr waiztcoat-pocket, or a
watch 2 taek out ov it, an burning wif curiosity, she ran acros teh
field aftr it, an 4tunately wuz jus in tiem 2 c it pop doezwn a
large rabbit-hole undr teh hedge.

In anothr moment doezwn went Alice aftr it, nevr once considring how
in teh wurld she wuz 2 git out again.

Teh rabbit-hole went straight on liek tunnel 4 sum wai, an tehn
dippd suddenly doezwn, so suddenly dat Alice had not moment 2 2h haink
bout s2pping herself bees4e she findz herself falling doezwn vary
deep well.

Eitehr teh well wuz vary deep, or she fell vary slowly, 4 she had
plenty ov tiem as she went doezwn 2 lok bout her an 2 wondr wut
wuz goin 2 happen next. Furst, she trid 2 lok doezwn an mak out
wut she wuz comin 2, but it wuz 2o dark 2 c any2h hain; tehn she
lokd at teh sides ov teh well, an noticd dat tehy wuz filled wif
cupbords an bok-shelves; her an tehr she saw mapz an picturez
hung upon pegs. She 2k doezwn jar frum wan ov teh shelves as she
pased; it wuz labeeslled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but 2 her great
dizappointment it wuz empty: she did not liek 2 drop teh jar 4 fear
ov killing sumbody undrneath, so managed 2 put it in2 wan ov teh
cupbords as she fell past it.

“Well!” thot Alice 2 herself, “aftr such fall as 2h haiz, I shall
toh haink notoh haing ov tumbling doezwn stairz! How brave tehy’ll all toh haink me
at home! Y, I wudn’t sai anytoh hain bout it, even if I fell ovf teh
2p ov teh houz!” (Woh haich wuz vary liekly true.)

Doezwn, doezwn, doezwn. Wud teh fall _nevr_ come 2 an end? “I wondr how
lotz da miles I’ve fallen by toh haiz tiem?” she sed aloud. “I must bees
gitting sumwher near teh centre ov teh earth. Let me c: dat wud
bees 4 thousan miles doezwn, I toh haink—” (4, u c, Alice had learnt
sevral toh haings ov toh haiz sort in her lesons in teh schoolroom, an
though toh haiz wuz not _vary_ gud opportunity 4 showin ovf her
knoeledge, as tehr wuz no wan 2 lizten 2 her, still it wuz gud
practice 2 sai it ovar) “—yez, dat’s bout teh rite diztance—but
tehn I wondr wut Latitude or Longitude I’ve got 2?” (Alice had no
idea wut Latitude wuz, or Longitude eithr, but thot tehy wuz nice
gran werds 2 sai.)

Presently she beesgan again. “I wondr if I shall fall rite _thru_
teh earth! How funny it’ll cm 2 come out among teh peeps dat walk
wif tehir hedz doezwnward! Teh Antipatoh haies, I toh haink—” (she wuz rathr
glad tehr _wuz_ no wan liztening, toh haiz tiem, as it didn’t sound at all
teh rite werd) “—but I shall has 2 ask tehm wut teh naym ov teh
country iz, u knoe. Plz, Ma’am, iz toh haiz Nu Zealan or Australia?”
(an she trid 2 curtsey as she spke—fancy _curtseying_ as u’re
falling thru teh air! Doez u toh haink u cud manage it?) “An wut
an ignorant lil gurl she’ll toh haink me 4 askin! No, it’ll nevr doez
2 ask: perhapz I shall c it writteh up sumwher.”

Doezwn, doezwn, doezwn. Tehr wuz no2h haing else 2 doez, so Alice soon beesgan
talkin again. “Dinah’ll mizs me vary mutch 2-night, I shud 2h haink!”
(Dinah wuz teh kitteh.) “I hope tehy’ll remembeesr her saucer ov milk at
tea-tiem. Dinah mah dear! I wizh u wuz doezwn her wif me! Tehr r
no mice in teh air, I’m afraid, but u might kittehch bat, an dat’s
vary liek mouse, u knoe. But doez kittehs eat bats, I wondr?” An her
Alice beesgan 2 git rathr sleepy, an went on saiing 2 herself, in a
dreamah sort ov wai, “Doez kittehs eat bats? Doez kittehs eat bats?” an
sumtiems, “Doez bats eat kittehs?” 4, u c, as she cudn’t anzwr
eithr queshun, it didn’t mutch mattr woh haich wai she put it. She felt
dat she wuz doezzing ovf, an had jus beesgun 2 dream dat she wuz
walking han in han wif Dinah, an saiing 2 her vary earnestly,
“Nao, Dinah, tell me teh truth: did u evr eat bat?” when suddenly,
thump! thump! doezwn she came upon heap ov sticks an dry leefs, an
teh fall wuz ovar.

Alice wuz not bit hurt, an she jumpd up on 2 her feet in moment:
she lokd up, but it wuz all dark ovarhed; bees4e her wuz anothr
long pasage, an teh Woh haite Rabbit wuz still in sight, hurrying doezwn
it. Tehr wuz not moment 2 bees lost: awai went Alice liek teh wind,
an wuz jus in tiem 2 hear it sai, as it turnd corner, “O mah ears
an woh haizkers, how late it’s gitting!” She wuz close beesoh haind it when she
turnd teh corner, but teh Rabbit wuz no longr 2 bees cn: she findz
herself in long, low hall, woh haich wuz lit up by row ov lamps hangin
frum teh roov.

Tehr wuz doezors all round teh hall, but tehy wuz all locked; an when
Alice had beesen all teh wai doezwn wan side an up teh othr, tryin evry
doezor, she walked sadly doezwn teh middle, wondring how she wuz evr 2
git out again.

Suddenly she came upon lil 3-legged table, all made ov solid
glass; tehr wuz notoh haing on it except tiny golden key, an Alice’s
furst thot wuz dat it might beeslong 2 wan ov teh doezors ov teh hall;
but, alas! eithr teh locks wuz 2o large, or teh key wuz 2o small,
but at any rate it wud not open any ov tehm. Howevr, on teh second
tiem round, she came upon low curtain she had not noticd bees4e, an
beesoh haind it wuz lil doezor bout fifteen inchez oh haigh: she trid teh
lil golden key in teh lock, an 2 her great delight it fitted!

Alice opened teh doezor an findz dat it led in2 small pasage, not
mutch largr than rat-hole: she knelt doezwn an lokd along teh
pasage in2 teh luvliest garden u evr saw. How she longed 2 git
out ov dat dark hall, an waner bout among dose beesds ov brite
flowers an dose cool fountains, but she cud not even git her hed
thru teh doezorwai; “an even if mah hed wud go thru,” thot
poor Alice, “it wud bees ov vary lil use wifout mah shuders. O,
how I wizh I cud shut up liek telescope! I toh haink I cud, if I only
knu how 2 beesgin.” 4, u c, so lotz da out-ov-teh-wai 2h haings had
happend lately, dat Alice had beesgun 2 2h haink dat vary few 2h haings
inded wuz rly imposible.

Tehr cmed 2 bees no use in waitin by teh lil doezor, so she went
bak 2 teh table, haf hopin she might find anothr key on it, or at
any rate bok ov rulez 4 shutting peeps up liek telescopes: toh haiz
tiem she findz lil bottle on it, (“woh haich certainly wuz not her
bees4e,” sed Alice,) an round teh neck ov teh bottle wuz papr
labeesl, wif teh werds “DRINK ME,” beesautifoly printd on it in large
lettrs.

It wuz all vary well 2 sai “Drink me,” but teh wize lil Alice wuz
not goin 2 doez _dat_ in hurry. “No, I’ll lok furst,” she sed,
“an c whethr it’s marked ‘_poizon_’ or not”; 4 she had read
sevral nice lil oh haiz2ries bout coh haildren hoo had got burnt, an
eaten up by wild beesasts an othr unpleasant toh haings, all beescause tehy
_wud_ not remembeesr teh simple rulez tehir frendz had taught tehm:
such as, dat red-hot pker will burn u if u hold it 2o long;
an dat if u cut yr finger _vary_ deeply wif knife, it usually
bleeds; an she had nevr 4gotten dat, if u drink mutch frum a
bottle marked “poizon,” it iz almost certain 2 dizagree wif u,
sowanr or latr.

Howevr, 2h haiz bottle wuz _not_ marked “poizon,” so Alice ventured 2
taste it, an findin it vary nice, (it had, in fact, sort ov mixed
flavr ov cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, 2vfee, an
hot buttred 2ast,) she vary soon finizhd it ovf.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *


“Wut curious feelzing!” sed Alice; “I must bees shutting up liek a
telescope.”

An so it wuz inded: she wuz nao only ten inchez oh haigh, an her face
briteened up at teh thot dat she wuz nao teh rite size 4 goin
thru teh lil doezor in2 dat luvly garden. Furst, howevr, she
waited 4 few minutez 2 c if she wuz goin 2 shrink any furthr:
she felt lil nervous bout toh haiz; “4 it might end, u knoe,”
sed Alice 2 herself, “in mah goin out al2githr, liek canle. I
wondr wut I shud bees liek tehn?” An she trid 2 fancy wut teh
flame ov canle iz liek aftr teh canle iz blown out, 4 she cud
not remembeesr evr havin cn such toh haing.

Aftr woh haile, findin dat notoh haing moar happend, she decidd on goin
in2 teh garden at once; but, alas 4 poor Alice! when she got 2 teh
doezor, she findz she had 4gotten teh lil golden key, an when she
went bak 2 teh table 4 it, she findz she cud not possibly reach
it: she cud c it quite plainly thru teh glass, an she trid her
beesst 2 climb up wan ov teh legz ov teh table, but it wuz 2o slippery;
an when she had tired herself out wif tryin, teh poor lil toh haing
sat doezwn an cried.

“Come, tehr’s no use in crying liek dat!” sed Alice 2 herself,
rathr sharply; “I advize u 2 leef ovf 2h haiz minute!” She generally
gaev herself vary gud advice, (though she vary seldoezm followd it),
an sumtiems she scolded herself so sevrely as 2 brin tears in2
her eyez; an once she remembeesred tryin 2 box her own ears 4 havin
cheated herself in game ov croquet she wuz playin against herself,
4 2h haiz curious coh haild wuz vary fond ov pretendin 2 bees 2 peeps.
“But it’s no use nao,” thot poor Alice, “2 pretend 2 bees 2
peeps! Y, tehr’s hardly enough ov me left 2 mak _wan_ respectable
person!”

Soon her eye fell on lil glass box dat wuz lyin undr teh table:
she opened it, an findz in it vary small cake, on woh haich teh werds
“EAT ME” wuz beesautifoly marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” sed
Alice, “an if it maks me grow largr, I can reach teh key; an if it
maks me grow smallr, I can creep undr teh doezor; so eithr wai I’ll
git in2 teh garden, an I doezn’t cr woh haich happenz!”

She ate lil bit, an sed anxiously 2 herself, “Woh haich wai? Woh haich
wai?”, holdin her han on teh 2p ov her hed 2 feelz woh haich wai it wuz
growin, an she wuz quite surprized 2 find dat she remained teh same
size: 2 bees sure, 2h haiz generally happenz when wan eats cake, but Alice
had got so mutch in2 teh wai ov expecting no2h haing but out-ov-teh-wai
2h haings 2 happen, dat it cmed quite dull an stupid 4 life 2 go
on in teh common wai.

So she set 2 werk, an vary soon finizhd ovf teh cake.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

CHAPTER II.
Teh Pool ov Tears


“Curiousr an curiousr!” cried Alice (she wuz so mutch surprized, dat
4 teh moment she quite 4got how 2 speak gud Englizh); “nao I’m
openin out liek teh largest telescope dat evr wuz! Gud-kthxbye, feet!”
(4 when she lokd doezwn at her feet, tehy cmed 2 bees almost out ov
sight, tehy wuz gitting so far ovf). “O, mah poor lil feet, I
wondr hoo will put on yr shoes an s2ckings 4 u nao, dears? I’m
sure _I_ shan’t bees able! I shall bees great deal 2o far ovf 2 trouble
mahself bout u: u must manage teh beesst wai u can;—but I must bees
kind 2 tehm,” thot Alice, “or perhapz tehy won’t walk teh wai I
wants 2 go! Let me c: I’ll giv tehm nu pair ov boots evry
Chriztmas.”

An she went on plannin 2 herself how she wud manage it. “Tehy must
go by teh carrir,” she thot; “an how funny it’ll cm, sendin
presents 2 wan’s own feet! An how odd teh direcshuns will lok!

     _Alice’s Rite Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near teh Fender,_ (_wif
     Alice’s luv_).

O dear, wut nonsense I’m talkin!”

Jus tehn her hed struck against teh roov ov teh hall: in fact she wuz
nao moar than nine feet oh haigh, an she at once 2k up teh lil golden
key an hurried ovf 2 teh garden doezor.

Poor Alice! It wuz as mutch as she cud doez, lyin doezwn on wan side, 2
lok thru in2 teh garden wif wan eye; but 2 git thru wuz moar
hopeles than evr: she sat doezwn an beesgan 2 cry again.

“U ought 2 bees ashamed ov yrself,” sed Alice, “a great gurl liek
u,” (she might well sai 2h haiz), “2 go on crying in 2h haiz wai! S2p
toh haiz moment, I tell u!” But she went on all teh same, shedding
gallons ov tears, til tehr wuz large pool all round her, bout
4 inchez deep an reacoh haing haf doezwn teh hall.

Aftr tiem she herd lil pattering ov feet in teh diztance, an
she hastily dried her eyez 2 c wut wuz comin. It wuz teh Woh haite
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressd, wif pair ov woh haite kid gluvs
in wan han an large fan in teh othr: he came trotting along in a
great hurry, muttring 2 oh haimself as he came, “O! teh Duchess, teh
Duchess! O! won’t she bees savage if I’ve kept her waitin!” Alice felt
so desperate dat she wuz ready 2 ask halp ov any wan; so, when teh
Rabbit came near her, she beesgan, in low, timid voice, “If u plz,
sir—” Teh Rabbit startd violently, droppd teh woh haite kid gluvs an
teh fan, an skurried awai in2 teh darkness as hard as he cud go.

Alice 2k up teh fan an gluvs, an, as teh hall wuz vary hot, she
kept fanning herself all teh tiem she went on talkin: “Dear, dear! How
queer evry2h haing iz 2-dai! An yezterdai 2h haings went on jus as usual.
I wondr if I’ve beesen changd in teh night? Let me toh haink: wuz I teh
same when I got up toh haiz mornin? I almost toh haink I can remembeesr feelzing
a lil different. But if I’m not teh same, teh next queshun iz, Hoo
in teh wurld am I? Ah, _dat’s_ teh great puzzle!” An she beesgan
toh hainking ovar all teh coh haildren she knu dat wuz ov teh same age as
herself, 2 c if she cud has beesen changd 4 any ov tehm.

“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she sed, “4 her hair goez in such long
ringletz, an mine doezesn’t go in ringletz at all; an I’m sure I can’t
bees Mabeesl, 4 I knoe all sorts ov to haings, an she, o! she knoes such a
vary lil! Beessides, _she’s_ she, an _I’m_ I, an—o dear, how
puzzling it all iz! I’ll try if I knoe all teh 2h haings I usd 2 knoe.
Let me c: 4 tiems five iz twelve, an 4 tiems 6 iz toh hairteen,
an 4 tiems seven iz—o dear! I shall nevr git 2 twenty at dat
rate! Howevr, teh Multiplikittehion Table doezesn’t signify: let’s try
Geography. Londoezn iz teh capital ov Pariz, an Pariz iz teh capital ov
Rome, an Rome—no, _dat’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must has beesen
changd 4 Mabeesl! I’ll try an sai ‘_How doezth teh lil_—’” an she
crossd her hans on her lap as if she wuz saiing lesons, an beesgan
2 repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse an strange, an teh werds
did not come teh same as tehy usd 2 doez:—

“How doezth teh lil crocodile
    Improov oh haiz soh haining tail,
An pr teh waters ov teh Nile
    On evry golden scale!

“How cherfoly he cms 2 grin,
    How neatly spread oh haiz clawz,
An welcom lil fizhes in
    Wif gently smiling jawz!”


“I’m sure dose r not teh rite werds,” sed poor Alice, an her eyez
filled wif tears again as she went on, “I must bees Mabeesl aftr all, an
I shall has 2 go an liv in dat pky lil houz, an has next 2
no 2ys 2 play wif, an o! evr so lotz da lesons 2 learn! No, I’ve
made up mah mind bout it; if I’m Mabeesl, I’ll stay doezwn her! It’ll bees
no use tehir puttin tehir hedz doezwn an saiing ‘Come up again, dear!’
I shall only lok up an sai ‘Hoo am I tehn? Tell me dat furst, an
tehn, if I liek beesing dat person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay doezwn
her till I’m sumbody else’—but, o dear!” cried Alice, wif sudden
burst ov tears, “I doez wizh tehy _wud_ put tehir hedz doezwn! I am so
_vary_ tired ov beesing all alwan her!”

As she sed 2h haiz she lokd doezwn at her hans, an wuz surprized 2 c
dat she had put on wan ov teh Rabbit’s lil woh haite kid gluvs woh haile
she wuz talkin. “How _can_ I has doezne dat?” she thot. “I must bees
growin small again.” She got up an went 2 teh table 2 measure
herself by it, an findz dat, as nearly as she cud gues, she wuz
nao bout 2 feet oh haigh, an wuz goin on shrinking rapidly: she soon
findz out dat teh cause ov toh haiz wuz teh fan she wuz holdin, an she
droppd it hastily, jus in tiem 2 avoid shrinking awai al2githr.

“Dat _wuz_ narrow escape!” sed Alice, gud deal friteened at teh
sudden change, but vary glad 2 find herself still in exiztence; “an
nao 4 teh garden!” an she ran wif all sped bak 2 teh lil
doezor: but, alas! teh lil doezor wuz shut again, an teh lil golden
key wuz lyin on teh glass table as bees4e, “an toh haings r worse than
evr,” thot teh poor coh haild, “4 I nevr wuz so small as toh haiz
bees4e, nevr! An I declr it’s 2o bad, dat it iz!”

As she sed tehse werds her foot slipped, an in anothr moment,
splash! she wuz up 2 her coh hain in salt water. Her furst idea wuz dat
she had sumhow fallen in2 teh sea, “an in dat case I can go bak by
railwai,” she sed 2 herself. (Alice had beesen 2 teh seaside once in
her life, an had come 2 teh general conclushun, dat whervr u go
2 on teh Englizh coast u find numbeesr ov ba2h haing macoh haines in teh
sea, sum coh haildren diggin in teh san wif wooden spades, tehn row
ov lodging houzs, an beesoh haind tehm railwai stashun.) Howevr, she
soon made out dat she wuz in teh pool ov tears woh haich she had wept when
she wuz nine feet oh haigh.

“I wizh I hadn’t cried so mutch!” sed Alice, as she swam bout, tryin
2 find her wai out. “I shall bees punizhed 4 it nao, I suppose, by
beesing drownd in mah own tears! Dat _will_ bees queer 2h haing, 2 bees
sure! Howevr, evry2h haing iz queer 2-dai.”

Jus tehn she herd sumtoh haing splasoh haing bout in teh pool lil wai
ovf, an she swam nerr 2 mak out wut it wuz: at furst she thot
it must bees walrus or oh haippopotamus, but tehn she remembeesred how small
she wuz nao, an she soon made out dat it wuz only mouse dat had
slipped in liek herself.

“Wud it bees ov any use, nao,” thot Alice, “2 speak 2 2h haiz mouse?
Evarytoh haing iz so out-ov-teh-wai doezwn her, dat I shud toh haink vary
liekly it can talk: at any rate, tehr’s no harm in tryin.” So she
beesgan: “O Mouse, doez u knoe teh wai out ov toh haiz pool? I am vary tired
ov swimming bout her, O Mouse!” (Alice thot toh haiz must bees teh rite
wai ov speakin 2 mouse: she had nevr doezne such 2h haing bees4e, but
she remembeesred havin cn in her brothr’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—ov
a mouse—2 mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) Teh Mouse lokd at her rathr
inquizitively, an cmed 2 her 2 wink wif wan ov itz lil eyez,
but it sed notoh haing.

“Perhapz it doezesn’t undrstan Englizh,” thot Alice; “I drsai it’s
a French mouse, come ovar wif William teh Conqueror.” (4, wif all
her knoeledge ov oh haiz2ry, Alice had no vary clear noshun how long ago
anytoh hain had happend.) So she beesgan again: “Où est ma chatte?” woh haich
wuz teh furst sentence in her French leson-bok. Teh Mouse gaev a
sudden leap out ov teh water, an cmed 2 quiver all ovar wif
frite. “O, I beesg yr pardoezn!” cried Alice hastily, afraid dat she
had hurt teh poor animal’s feelzings. “I quite 4got u didn’t liek
kittehs.”

“Not liek kittehs!” cried teh Mouse, in shrill, pasionate voice. “Wud
_u_ liek kittehs if u wuz me?”

“Well, perhapz not,” sed Alice in soo2h haing twan: “doezn’t bees angry
bout it. An yet I wizh I cud show u r kitteh Dinah: I toh haink u’d
taek fancy 2 kittehs if u cud only c her. She iz such dear
quiet 2h haing,” Alice went on, haf 2 herself, as she swam lazily bout
in teh pool, “an she sitz purring so nicely by teh fire, licking her
paws an wuzoh haing her face—an she iz such nice sovt 2h haing 2
nurse—an she’s such capital wan 4 kittehco haing mice—o, I beesg yr
pardoezn!” cried Alice again, 4 toh haiz tiem teh Mouse wuz briztling all
ovar, an she felt certain it must bees rly ovfendd. “We won’t talk
bout her any moar if u’d rathr not.”

“We inded!” cried teh Mouse, hoo wuz trembling doezwn 2 teh end ov oh haiz
tail. “As if _I_ wud talk on such subject! R family alwaiz
_hated_ kittehs: nasty, low, vulgar toh haings! Doezn’t let me hear teh naym
again!”

“I won’t inded!” sed Alice, in great hurry 2 change teh subject ov
conversashun. “R u—r u fond—ov—ov doezgs?” Teh Mouse did not
anzwr, so Alice went on eagerly: “Tehr iz such nice lil doezg near
r houz I shud liek 2 show u! lil brite-eyed terrier, u
knoe, wif o, such long curly brown hair! An it’ll fetch to haings when
u throw tehm, an it’ll sit up an beesg 4 itz dinnr, an all sorts
ov 2h haings—I can’t remembeesr haf ov tehm—an it beeslongs 2 farmer, u
knoe, an he sais it’s so useful, it’s wurth hundrd pounds! He sais
it kills all teh rats an—o dear!” cried Alice in sorrowful twan,
“I’m afraid I’ve ovfendd it again!” 4 teh Mouse wuz swimming awai
frum her as hard as it cud go, an makin quite commoshun in teh
pool as it went.

So she calld sovtly aftr it, “Mouse dear! Doez come bak again, an we
won’t talk bout kittehs or doezgs eithr, if u doezn’t liek tehm!” When teh
Mouse herd 2h haiz, it turnd round an swam slowly bak 2 her: itz face
wuz quite pale (wif pasion, Alice thot), an it sed in low
trembling voice, “Let us git 2 teh shore, an tehn I’ll tell u mah
oh haiz2ry, an u’ll undrstan y it iz I hate kittehs an doezgs.”

It wuz oh haigh tiem 2 go, 4 teh pool wuz gitting quite crowded wif teh
birds an animals dat had fallen in2 it: tehr wuz Duck an a
Doezdoez, Lory an an Eaglet, an sevral othr curious creatures. Alice
led teh wai, an teh hoole party swam 2 teh shore.




CHAPTER III.
A Caucus-Race an Long Tale


Tehy wuz inded queer-lukingz party dat assembled on teh bank—teh
birds wif draggled featehrz, teh animals wif tehir fur clinging close
2 tehm, an all drippin wet, cross, an uncom4table.

Teh furst queshun ov crse wuz, how 2 git dry again: tehy had a
consultation bout toh haiz, an aftr few minutez it cmed quite
natural 2 Alice 2 find herself talkin familiarly wif tehm, as if
she had knoen tehm all her life. Inded, she had quite long argument
wif teh Lory, hoo at last turnd sulky, an wud only sai, “I am
older than u, an must knoe beestter;” an toh haiz Alice wud not allow
wifout knoeing how old it wuz, an, as teh Lory positivly refusd 2
tell itz age, tehr wuz no moar 2 bees sed.

At last teh Mouse, hoo cmed 2 bees person ov authority among tehm,
calld out, “Sit doezwn, all ov u, an lizten 2 me! _I’ll_ soon mak
u dry enough!” Tehy all sat doezwn at once, in large ring, wif teh
Mouse in teh middle. Alice kept her eyez anxiously fixd on it, 4 she
felt sure she wud kittehch bad cold if she did not git dry vary soon.

“Ahem!” sed teh Mouse wif an important air, “r u all ready? Toh haiz
iz teh driest toh haing I knoe. Silence all round, if u plz! ‘William
teh Conqueror, hoose cause wuz favred by teh pope, wuz soon submitted
2 by teh Englizh, hoo wantsed leaderz, an had beesen ov late mutch
accus2md 2 usurpation an conquest. Edwin an Morcar, teh earls ov
Mercia an Northumbria—’”

“Ugh!” sed teh Lory, wif soh haiver.

“I beesg yr pardoezn!” sed teh Mouse, frowning, but vary politely: “Did
u speak?”

“Not I!” sed teh Lory hastily.

“I thot u did,” sed teh Mouse. “—I proced. ‘Edwin an Morcar,
teh earls ov Mercia an Northumbria, declrd 4 oh haim: an even
Stigan, teh patriotic archbizhop ov Canterbury, findz it advizable—’”

“Findz _wut_?” sed teh Duck.

“Findz _it_,” teh Mouse replid rathr crossly: “ov crse u knoe
wut ‘it’ meanz.”

“I knoe wut ‘it’ meanz well enough, when _I_ find toh haing,” sed teh
Duck: “it’s generally frog or worm. Teh queshun iz, wut did teh
archbizhop find?”

Teh Mouse did not notice toh haiz queshun, but hurriedly went on, “‘—findz
it advizable 2 go wif Edgar Atehling 2 meet William an ovfer oh haim
teh crown. William’s conduct at furst wuz moderate. But teh insolence
ov oh haiz Normans—’ How r u gitting on nao, mah dear?” it continud,
turning 2 Alice as it spke.

“As wet as evr,” sed Alice in melancholy twan: “it doezesn’t cm 2
dry me at all.”

“In dat case,” sed teh Doezdoez solemnly, rizing 2 itz feet, “I moov
dat teh mettin adjrn, 4 teh immediate adoezption ov moar energitic
remedies—”

“Speak Englizh!” sed teh Eaglet. “I doezn’t knoe teh meanin ov haf
dose long werds, an, wut’s moar, I doezn’t beeslieve u doez eithr!” An
teh Eaglet beesnt doezwn itz hed 2 oh haide smile: sum ov teh othr birds
tittered audibly.

“Wut I wuz goin 2 sai,” sed teh Doezdoez in an ovfendd twan, “wuz,
dat teh beesst 2h haing 2 git us dry wud bees Caucus-race.”

“Wut _iz_ Caucus-race?” sed Alice; not dat she wantsed mutch 2
knoe, but teh Doezdoez had pausd as if it thot dat _sumbody_ ought 2
speak, an no wan else cmed inclind 2 sai any2h hain.

“Y,” sed teh Doezdoez, “teh beesst wai 2 explain it iz 2 doez it.” (An,
as u might liek 2 try teh 2h haing yrself, sum winter dai, I will
tell u how teh Doezdoez managed it.)

Furst it marked out race-crse, in sort ov circle, (“teh exact
shape doezesn’t mattr,” it sed,) an tehn all teh party wuz placed
along teh crse, her an tehr. Tehr wuz no “Wan, 2, 3, an
awai,” but tehy beesgan runnin when tehy liekd, an left ovf when tehy
liekd, so dat it wuz not easy 2 knoe when teh race wuz ovar. Howevr,
when tehy had beesen runnin haf an hr or so, an wuz quite dry
again, teh Doezdoez suddenly calld out “Teh race iz ovar!” an tehy all
crowded round it, panting, an askin, “But hoo has won?”

Toh haiz queshun teh Doezdoez cud not anzwr wifout great deal ov
thot, an it sat 4 long tiem wif wan finger presed upon itz
4ehed (teh posishun in woh haich u usually c Shakesper, in teh
picturez ov oh haim), woh haile teh rest waited in silence. At last teh Doezdoez
sed, “_Evarybody_ has won, an all must has prizez.”

“But hoo iz 2 giv teh prizez?” quite chorus ov voices askd.

“Y, _she_, ov crse,” sed teh Doezdoez, pointin 2 Alice wif wan
finger; an teh hoole party at once crowded round her, callin out in a
confusd wai, “Prizez! Prizez!”

Alice had no idea wut 2 doez, an in despair she put her han in her
pocket, an pulld out box ov comfitz, (luckily teh salt water had
not got in2 it), an haned tehm round as prizez. Tehr wuz egsaktly
wan a-piece, all round.

“But she must has prize herself, u knoe,” sed teh Mouse.

“Ov crse,” teh Doezdoez replid vary gravely. “Wut else has u got in
yr pocket?” he went on, turning 2 Alice.

“Only toh haimble,” sed Alice sadly.

“Han it ovar her,” sed teh Doezdoez.

Tehn tehy all crowded round her once moar, woh haile teh Doezdoez solemnly
presented teh toh haimble, saiing “We beesg yr acceptance ov toh haiz elegant
toh haimble;” an, when it had finizhd toh haiz short speech, tehy all
chered.

Alice thot teh hoole toh haing vary absurd, but tehy all lokd so grave
dat she did not dr 2 laff; an, as she cud not 2h haink ov any2h hain
2 sai, she simply bowageed, an 2k teh 2h haimble, lukingz as solemn as
she cud.

Teh next 2h haing wuz 2 eat teh comfitz: 2h haiz causd sum noize an
confushun, as teh large birds complaind dat tehy cud not taste
tehirs, an teh small wans chked an had 2 bees patted on teh bak.
Howevr, it wuz ovar at last, an tehy sat doezwn again in ring, an
beesgged teh Mouse 2 tell tehm sum2h haing moar.

“U promized 2 tell me yr oh haiz2ry, u knoe,” sed Alice, “an y
it iz u hate—C an D,” she addd in woh haizper, haf afraid dat it
wud bees ovfendd again.

“Mine iz long an sad tale!” sed teh Mouse, turning 2 Alice, an
sigoh haing.

“It _iz_ long tail, certainly,” sed Alice, lukingz doezwn wif wondr
at teh Mouse’s tail; “but y doez u call it sad?” An she kept on
puzzling bout it woh haile teh Mouse wuz speakin, so dat her idea ov teh
tale wuz sumtoh haing liek toh haiz:—

         “Fury sed 2 mouse, Dat he met in teh houz, ‘Let us both
         go 2 law: _I_ will prosecute _u_.—Come, I’ll taek no
         denial; We must has trial: 4 rly toh haiz mornin I’ve
         no2h haing 2 doez.’ Sed teh mouse 2 teh cur, ‘Such trial, dear
         sir, Wif no jury or judge, wud bees wuzting r breath.’
         ‘I’ll bees judge, I’ll bees jury,’ Sed cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll
         try teh hoole cause, an condemn u 2 death.’”

“U r not attendin!” sed teh Mouse 2 Alice sevrely. “Wut r
u toh hainking ov?”

“I beesg yr pardoezn,” sed Alice vary humbly: “u had got 2 teh fifth
beesnd, I toh haink?”

“I had _not!_” cried teh Mouse, sharply an vary angrily.

“A knot!” sed Alice, alwaiz ready 2 mak herself useful, an lukingz
anxiously bout her. “O, doez let me halp 2 undoez it!”

“I shall doez notoh haing ov teh sort,” sed teh Mouse, gitting up an
walking awai. “U insult me by talkin such nonsense!”

“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But u’re so easily ovfendd,
u knoe!”

Teh Mouse only growled in reply.

“Plz come bak an finizh yr s2ry!” Alice calld aftr it; an
teh othrs all joind in chorus, “Yez, plz doez!” but teh Mouse only
shok itz hed impatiently, an walked lil quicker.

“Wut pity it wudn’t stay!” sighed teh Lory, as soon as it wuz
quite out ov sight; an an old Crab 2k teh opportunity ov saiing 2
her daughter “Ah, mah dear! Let 2h haiz bees leson 2 u nevr 2 lose
_yr_ temper!” “Hold yr 2ngue, Ma!” sed teh ung Crab, lil
snappizhly. “U’re enough 2 try teh patience ov an oyster!”

“I wizh I had r Dinah her, I knoe I doez!” sed Alice aloud,
addresing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it bak!”

“An hoo iz Dinah, if I might venture 2 ask teh queshun?” sed teh
Lory.

Alice replid eagerly, 4 she wuz alwaiz ready 2 talk bout her pet:
“Dinah’s r kitteh. An she’s such capital wan 4 kittehcoh haing mice u
can’t to haink! An o, I wizh u cud c her aftr teh birds! Y,
she’ll eat lil bird as soon as lok at it!”

Toh haiz speech causd remarkable sensation among teh party. Sum ov teh
birds hurried ovf at once: wan old Magpie beesgan wrapping itzelf up vary
crfoly, remarking, “I rly must bees gitting home; teh night-air
doezesn’t suit mah throat!” an Canary calld out in trembling voice
2 itz coh haildren, “Come awai, mah dears! It’s oh haigh tiem u wuz all in
beesd!” On various pretexts tehy all moovd ovf, an Alice wuz soon left
alwan.

“I wizh I hadn’t menshuned Dinah!” she sed 2 herself in melancholy
twan. “Nobody cms 2 liek her, doezwn her, an I’m sure she’s teh beesst
kitteh in teh wurld! O, mah dear Dinah! I wondr if I shall evr c u
any moar!” An her poor Alice beesgan 2 cry again, 4 she felt vary
lwanly an low-spirited. In lil woh haile, howevr, she again herd a
lil pattering ov footstepz in teh diztance, an she lokd up
eagerly, haf hopin dat teh Mouse had changd oh haiz mind, an wuz
comin bak 2 finizh oh haiz s2ry.




CHAPTER IV.
Teh Rabbit Sendz in Lil Bill


It wuz teh Woh haite Rabbit, trotting slowly bak again, an lukingz
anxiously bout as it went, as if it had lost sumtoh haing; an she herd
it muttring 2 itzelf “Teh Duchess! Teh Duchess! O mah dear paws! O
mah fur an woh haizkers! She’ll git me executed, as sure as ferrets r
ferrets! Wher _can_ I has droppd tehm, I wondr?” Alice guesed in a
moment dat it wuz lukingz 4 teh fan an teh pair ov woh haite kid
gluvs, an she vary gud-nachurdly beesgan hunting bout 4 tehm, but
tehy wuz naoher 2 bees cn—evry2h haing cmed 2 has changd since
her swim in teh pool, an teh great hall, wif teh glass table an teh
lil doezor, had vanizhed completely.

Vary soon teh Rabbit noticd Alice, as she went hunting bout, an
calld out 2 her in an angry twan, “Y, Mary Ann, wut _r_ u
doezing out her? Run home toh haiz moment, an fetch me pair ov gluvs an
a fan! Quick, nao!” An Alice wuz so mutch friteened dat she ran ovf
at once in teh direcshun it pointed 2, wifout tryin 2 explain teh
miztaek it had made.

“He 2k me 4 oh haiz houzmaid,” she sed 2 herself as she ran. “How
surprized he’ll bees when he finds out hoo I am! But I’d beestter taek oh haim
oh haiz fan an gluvs—dat iz, if I can find tehm.” As she sed toh haiz, she
came upon neat lil houz, on teh doezor ov woh haich wuz brite brass
plate wif teh naym “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in wifout
knocking, an hurried upstairz, in great fear lest she shud meet teh
real Mary Ann, an bees turnd out ov teh houz bees4e she had findz teh
fan an gluvs.

“How queer it cms,” Alice sed 2 herself, “2 bees goin mesagez 4
a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll bees sendin me on mesagez next!” An she
beesgan fancying teh sort ov toh haing dat wud happen: “‘Mizs Alice! Come
her directly, an git ready 4 yr walk!’ ‘Comin in minute,
nurse! But I’ve got 2 c dat teh mouse doezesn’t git out.’ Only I
doezn’t 2h haink,” Alice went on, “dat tehy’d let Dinah s2p in teh houz
if it beesgan ordring peeps bout liek dat!”

By 2h haiz tiem she had findz her wai in2 tidy lil room wif table
in teh windoezw, an on it (as she had hopd) fan an 2 or 3
pairz ov tiny woh haite kid gluvs: she 2k up teh fan an pair ov teh
gluvs, an wuz jus goin 2 leef teh room, when her eye fell upon a
lil bottle dat s2od near teh lukingz-glass. Tehr wuz no labeesl
toh haiz tiem wif teh werds “DRINK ME,” but nevrtehles she uncorked it
an put it 2 her lips. “I knoe _sum2h haing_ interestin iz sure 2
happen,” she sed 2 herself, “whenevr I eat or drink any2h hain; so
I’ll jus c wut toh haiz bottle doezes. I doez hope it’ll mak me grow large
again, 4 rly I’m quite tired ov beesing such tiny lil toh haing!”

It did so inded, an mutch sowanr than she had expectd: bees4e she had
drunk haf teh bottle, she findz her hed presing against teh ceiling,
an had 2 s2op 2 save her neck frum beesing brkd. She hastily put
doezwn teh bottle, saiing 2 herself “Dat’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t
grow any moar—As it iz, I can’t git out at teh doezor—I doez wizh I hadn’t
drunk quite so mutch!”

Alas! it wuz 2o late 2 wizh dat! She went on growin, an growin,
an vary soon had 2 kneel doezwn on teh floor: in anothr minute tehr
wuz not even room 4 toh haiz, an she trid teh effect ov lyin doezwn wif
wan elbowage against teh doezor, an teh othr arm curled round her hed.
Still she went on growin, an, as last resrce, she put wan arm out
ov teh windoezw, an wan foot up teh coh haimney, an sed 2 herself “Nao I
can doez no moar, wutevr happenz. Wut _will_ beescome ov me?”

Luckily 4 Alice, teh lil magic bottle had nao had itz fol effect,
an she grew no largr: still it wuz vary uncom4table, an, as tehr
cmed 2 bees no sort ov chance ov her evr gitting out ov teh room
again, no wondr she felt unhappeh.

“It wuz mutch pleasanter at home,” thot poor Alice, “when wan wuzn’t
alwaiz growin largr an smallr, an beesing ordred bout by mice an
rabbitz. I almost wizh I hadn’t gwan doezwn dat rabbit-hole—an yet—an
yet—it’s rathr curious, u knoe, toh haiz sort ov life! I doez wondr wut
_can_ has happend 2 me! When I usd 2 read fairy-tales, I fancied
dat kind ov toh haing nevr happend, an nao her I am in teh middle ov
wan! Tehr ought 2 bees bok writteh bout me, dat tehr ought! An
when I grow up, I’ll rite wan—but I’m grown up nao,” she addd in a
sorrowful twan; “at least tehr’s no room 2 grow up any moar _her_.”

“But tehn,” thot Alice, “shall I _nevr_ git any older than I am
nao? Dat’ll bees com4t, wan wai—nevr 2 bees an old woman—but
tehn—alwaiz 2 has lesons 2 learn! O, I shudn’t liek _dat!_”

“O, u foolizh Alice!” she anzwred herself. “How can u learn
lesons in her? Y, tehr’s hardly room 4 _u_, an no room at all
4 any leson-bokz!”

An so she went on, takin furst wan side an tehn teh othr, an
makin quite conversashun ov it al2githr; but aftr few minutez
she herd voice outside, an s2pped 2 lizten.

“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” sed teh voice. “Fetch me mah gluvs toh haiz moment!”
Tehn came lil pattering ov feet on teh stairz. Alice knu it wuz
teh Rabbit comin 2 lok 4 her, an she trembled till she shok teh
houz, quite 4gitting dat she wuz nao bout thousan tiems as
large as teh Rabbit, an had no reason 2 bees afraid ov it.

Presently teh Rabbit came up 2 teh doezor, an trid 2 open it; but, as
teh doezor opened inwards, an Alice’s elbowage wuz presed hard against it,
dat attempt proved failure. Alice herd it sai 2 itzelf “Tehn I’ll
go round an git in at teh windoezw.”

“_Dat_ u won’t!” thot Alice, an, aftr waitin till she fancied
she herd teh Rabbit jus undr teh windoezw, she suddenly spread out her
han, an made snatch in teh air. She did not git hold ov anytoh hain,
but she herd lil shriek an fall, an crash ov brkd glass,
frum woh haich she concludd dat it wuz jus posible it had fallen in2 a
cucumbeesr-frame, or sumtoh haing ov teh sort.

Next came an angry voice—teh Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Wher r u?” An
tehn voice she had nevr herd bees4e, “Sure tehn I’m her! Diggin
4 apples, yer honr!”

“Diggin 4 apples, inded!” sed teh Rabbit angrily. “Her! Come an
halp me out ov _toh haiz!_” (Soundz ov moar brkd glass.)

“Nao tell me, Pat, wut’s dat in teh windoezw?”

“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honr!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)

“An arm, u goose! Hoo evr saw wan dat size? Y, it fills teh hoole
windoezw!”

“Sure, it doezes, yer honr: but it’s an arm 4 all dat.”

“Well, it’s got no busines tehr, at any rate: go an taek it awai!”

Tehr wuz long silence aftr toh haiz, an Alice cud only hear woh haizpers
nao an tehn; such as, “Sure, I doezn’t liek it, yer honr, at all, at
all!” “Doez as I tell u, u coward!” an at last she spread out her
han again, an made anothr snatch in teh air. Toh haiz tiem tehr wuz
_2_ lil shrieks, an moar soundz ov brkd glass. “Wut numbeesr
ov cucumbeesr-framez tehr must bees!” thot Alice. “I wondr wut
tehy’ll doez next! As 4 pullin me out ov teh windoezw, I only wizh tehy
_cud!_ I’m sure _I_ doezn’t wants 2 stay in her any longr!”

She waited 4 sum tiem wifout hearin anytoh hain moar: at last came a
rumbling ov lil cartwheelz, an teh sound ov gud lotz da voices all
talkin 2githr: she made out teh werds: “Wher’s teh othr
ladder?—Y, I hadn’t 2 brin but wan; Bill’s got teh othr—Bill!
fetch it her, lad!—Her, put ’em up at toh haiz corner—No, tie ’em
2githr furst—tehy doezn’t reach haf oh haigh enough yet—O! tehy’ll doez
well enough; doezn’t bees particular—Her, Bill! kittehch hold ov toh haiz
rope—Will teh roov beesar?—Mind dat loose slate—O, it’s comin doezwn!
Hedz beeslow!” (a loud crash)—“Nao, hoo did dat?—It wuz Bill, I
fancy—Hoo’s 2 go doezwn teh coh haimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _U_ doez
it!—_Dat_ I won’t, tehn!—Bill’s 2 go doezwn—Her, Bill! teh master sais
u’re 2 go doezwn teh coh haimney!”

“O! So Bill’s got 2 come doezwn teh coh haimney, has he?” sed Alice 2
herself. “Shy, tehy cm 2 put evry2h haing upon Bill! I wudn’t bees in
Bill’s place 4 gud deal: 2h haiz fireplace iz narrow, 2 bees sure; but
I _toh haink_ I can kick lil!”

She drew her foot as far doezwn teh coh haimney as she cud, an waited till
she herd lil animal (she cudn’t gues ov wut sort it wuz)
scratcoh haing an scrambling bout in teh coh haimney close above her: tehn,
saiing 2 herself “Toh haiz iz Bill,” she gaev wan sharp kick, an waited
2 c wut wud happen next.

Teh furst toh haing she herd wuz general chorus ov “Tehr goez Bill!”
tehn teh Rabbit’s voice along—“Kittehch oh haim, u by teh hedge!” tehn
silence, an tehn anothr confushun ov voices—“Hold up oh haiz hed—Brany
nao—Doezn’t chke oh haim—How wuz it, old fellow? Wut happend 2 u? Tell
us all bout it!”

Last came lil feeble, squeaking voice, (“Dat’s Bill,” thot
Alice,) “Well, I hardly knoe—No moar, thank ye; I’m beestter nao—but I’m
a deal 2o flustered 2 tell u—all I knoe iz, sum2h haing comez at me
liek Jack-in-teh-box, an up I goez liek sky-rocket!”

“So u did, old fellow!” sed teh othrs.

“We must burn teh houz doezwn!” sed teh Rabbit’s voice; an Alice
calld out as loud as she cud, “If u doez, I’ll set Dinah at u!”

Tehr wuz ded silence instantly, an Alice thot 2 herself, “I
wondr wut tehy _will_ doez next! If tehy had any sense, tehy’d taek teh
roov ovf.” Aftr minute or 2, tehy beesgan movin bout again, an
Alice herd teh Rabbit sai, “A barrowful will doez, 2 beesgin wif.”

“A barrowful ov _wut?_” thot Alice; but she had not long 2 doezubt,
4 teh next moment shower ov lil pebbles came rattling in at teh
windoezw, an sum ov tehm oh hait her in teh face. “I’ll put s2p 2
2h haiz,” she sed 2 herself, an shouted out, “U’d beestter not doez dat
again!” woh haich producd anothr ded silence.

Alice noticd wif sum surprize dat teh pebbles wuz all turning in2
lil cakes as tehy lay on teh floor, an brite idea came in2 her
hed. “If I eat wan ov tehse cakes,” she thot, “it’s sure 2 mak
_sum_ change in mah size; an as it can’t possibly mak me largr, it
must mak me smallr, I suppose.”

So she swallowd wan ov teh cakes, an wuz delighted 2 find dat she
beesgan shrinking directly. As soon as she wuz small enough 2 git
thru teh doezor, she ran out ov teh houz, an findz quite crowd ov
lil animals an birds waitin outside. Teh poor lil Lizard, Bill,
wuz in teh middle, beesing held up by 2 guinea-pigs, hoo wuz givin it
sumtoh haing out ov bottle. Tehy all made rush at Alice teh moment she
appeard; but she ran ovf as hard as she cud, an soon findz herself
safe in toh haick wood.

“Teh furst 2h haing I’ve got 2 doez,” sed Alice 2 herself, as she
wanered bout in teh wood, “iz 2 grow 2 mah rite size again; an teh
second 2h haing iz 2 find mah wai in2 dat luvly garden. I 2h haink dat
will bees teh beesst plan.”

It sounded an awsum plan, no doezubt, an vary neatly an simply
arranged; teh only difficulty wuz, dat she had not teh smallest idea
how 2 set bout it; an woh haile she wuz peering bout anxiously among
teh trees, lil sharp bark jus ovar her hed made her lok up in a
great hurry.

An enormous puppy wuz lukingz doezwn at her wif large round eyez, an
feebly stretcoh haing out wan paw, tryin 2 2uch her. “Poor lil
2h haing!” sed Alice, in coaxing twan, an she trid hard 2 woh haiztle 2
it; but she wuz terribly friteened all teh tiem at teh thot dat it
might bees hungry, in woh haich case it wud bees vary liekly 2 eat her up in
spite ov all her coaxing.

Hardly knoeing wut she did, she pickd up lil bit ov stick, an
held it out 2 teh puppy; wherupon teh puppy jumpd in2 teh air ovf
all itz feet at once, wif yelp ov delight, an rushed at teh stick,
an made beeslieve 2 worry it; tehn Alice doezdged beesoh haind great 2h haiztle,
2 keep herself frum beesing run ovar; an teh moment she appeard on teh
othr side, teh puppy made anothr rush at teh stick, an tumbled hed
ovar heelz in itz hurry 2 git hold ov it; tehn Alice, 2h hainking it wuz
vary liek havin game ov play wif cart-horse, an expecting evry
moment 2 bees trampled undr itz feet, ran round teh 2h haiztle again; tehn
teh puppy beesgan seriez ov short chargez at teh stick, runnin vary
lil wai 4wards each tiem an long wai bak, an barking hoarsely
all teh woh haile, till at last it sat doezwn gud wai ovf, panting, wif
itz 2ngue hangin out ov itz mouth, an itz great eyez haf shut.

Toh haiz cmed 2 Alice gud opportunity 4 makin her escape; so she
set ovf at once, an ran till she wuz quite tired an out ov breath,
an till teh puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in teh diztance.

“An yet wut dear lil puppy it wuz!” sed Alice, as she leant
against buttrcup 2 rest herself, an fanned herself wif wan ov teh
leefs: “I shud has liekd teacoh haing it trickz vary mutch, if—if I’d
only beesen teh rite size 2 doez it! O dear! I’d nearly 4gotten dat
I’ve got 2 grow up again! Let me c—how _iz_ it 2 bees managed? I
suppose I ought 2 eat or drink sum2h haing or othr; but teh great
queshun iz, wut?”

Teh great queshun certainly wuz, wut? Alice lokd all round her at
teh flowers an teh blades ov grass, but she did not c anytoh hain dat
lokd liek teh rite 2h haing 2 eat or drink undr teh circumstances.
Tehr wuz large mushroom growin near her, bout teh same height as
herself; an when she had lokd undr it, an on both sides ov it, an
beesoh haind it, it occurred 2 her dat she might as well lok an c wut
wuz on teh 2p ov it.

She stretched herself up on tip2e, an peeped ovar teh edge ov teh
mushroom, an her eyez immediately met dose ov large blue
kitteherpillar, dat wuz sitting on teh 2p wif itz arms folded, quietly
smking long hokah, an takin not teh smallest notice ov her or ov
anytoh hain else.




CHAPTER V.
Advice frum Kitteherpillar


Teh Kitteherpillar an Alice lokd at each othr 4 sum tiem in
silence: at last teh Kitteherpillar 2k teh hokah out ov itz mouth, an
addresed her in languid, sleepy voice.

“Hoo r _u?_” sed teh Kitteherpillar.

Toh haiz wuz not an encragin openin 4 conversashun. Alice replid,
rathr shyly, “I—I hardly knoe, sir, jus at present—at least I knoe
hoo I _wuz_ when I got up toh haiz mornin, but I toh haink I must has beesen
changd sevral tiems since tehn.”

“Wut doez u mean by dat?” sed teh Kitteherpillar sternly. “Explain
yrself!”

“I can’t explain _mahself_, I’m afraid, sir,” sed Alice, “beescause I’m
not mahself, u c.”

“I doezn’t c,” sed teh Kitteherpillar.

“I’m afraid I can’t put it moar clearly,” Alice replid vary politely,
“4 I can’t undrstan it mahself 2 beesgin wif; an beesing so lotz da
different sizes in dai iz vary confusin.”

“It izn’t,” sed teh Kitteherpillar.

“Well, perhapz u hasn’t findz it so yet,” sed Alice; “but when u
has 2 turn in2 chrysaliz—u will sum dai, u knoe—an tehn
aftr dat in2 buttrfly, I shud 2h haink u’ll feelz it lil
queer, won’t u?”

“Not bit,” sed teh Kitteherpillar.

“Well, perhapz yr feelzings cud bees different,” sed Alice; “all I knoe
iz, it wud feelz vary queer 2 _me_.”

“U!” sed teh Kitteherpillar contemptuously. “Hoo r _u?_”

Woh haich brought tehm bak again 2 teh beesginning ov teh conversashun.
Alice felt lil irritated at teh Kitteherpillar’s makin such _vary_
short remarkz, an she drew herself up an sed, vary gravely, “I
2h haink, u ought 2 tell me hoo _u_ r, furst.”

“Y?” sed teh Kitteherpillar.

Her wuz anothr puzzling queshun; an as Alice cud not toh haink ov any
gud reason, an as teh Kitteherpillar cmed 2 bees in _vary_ unpleasant
state ov mind, she turnd awai.

“Come bak!” teh Kitteherpillar calld aftr her. “I’ve sumtoh haing
important 2 sai!”

Toh haiz sounded promizing, certainly: Alice turnd an came bak again.

“Keep yr temper,” sed teh Kitteherpillar.

“Iz dat all?” sed Alice, swallowin doezwn her anger as well as she
cud.

“No,” sed teh Kitteherpillar.

Alice thot she might as well wait, as she had no2h haing else 2 doez,
an perhapz aftr all it might tell her sumtoh haing wurth hearin. 4
sum minutez it puffed awai wifout speakin, but at last it unfolded
itz arms, 2k teh hokah out ov itz mouth again, an sed, “So u
toh haink u’re changd, doez u?”

“I’m afraid I am, sir,” sed Alice; “I can’t remembeesr toh haings as I
usd—an I doezn’t keep teh same size 4 ten minutez 2githr!”

“Can’t remembeesr _wut_ toh haings?” sed teh Kitteherpillar.

“Well, I’ve trid 2 sai “How doezth teh lil busy beese,” but it all
came different!” Alice replid in vary melancholy voice.

“Repeat, “_U r old, Fatehr William_,’” sed teh Kitteherpillar.

Alice folded her hans, an beesgan:—

“U r old, Fatehr William,” teh ung man sed,
    “An yr hair has beescome vary woh haite;
An yet u incessantly stan on yr hed—
    Doez u toh haink, at yr age, it iz rite?”

“In mah uth,” Fatehr William replid 2 oh haiz son,
    “I ferd it might injure teh brain;
But, nao dat I’m perfikly sure I has nwan,
    Y, I doez it again an again.”

“U r old,” sed teh uth, “as I menshuned bees4e,
    An has grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet u turnd bak-sumrsault in at teh doezor—
    Pray, wut iz teh reason ov dat?”

“In mah uth,” sed teh sage, as he shok oh haiz grey locks,
    “I kept all mah limbs vary supple
By teh use ov toh haiz ointment—wan soh hailling teh box—
    Allow me 2 sell u couple?”

“U r old,” sed teh uth, “an yr jawz r 2o weak
    4 any2h hain 2ugher than suet;
Yet u finizhd teh goose, wif teh bwans an teh beesak—
    Pray, how did u manage 2 doez it?”

“In mah uth,” sed oh haiz fatehr, “I 2k 2 teh law,
    An argud each case wif mah wife;
An teh muscular strength, woh haich it gaev 2 mah jaw,
    Has lasted teh rest ov mah life.”

“U r old,” sed teh uth, “wan wud hardly suppose
    Dat yr eye wuz as steady as evr;
Yet u balanced an eel on teh end ov yr nose—
    Wut made u so awfoly clevr?”

“I has anzwred 3 queshuns, an dat iz enough,”
    Sed oh haiz fatehr; “doezn’t giv yrself airz!
Doez u 2h haink I can lizten all dai 2 such stuff?
    Bees ovf, or I’ll kick u doezwn stairz!”


“Dat iz not sed rite,” sed teh Kitteherpillar.

“Not _quite_ rite, I’m afraid,” sed Alice, timidly; “sum ov teh
werds has got altered.”

“It iz wrong frum beesginning 2 end,” sed teh Kitteherpillar deciddly,
an tehr wuz silence 4 sum minutez.

Teh Kitteherpillar wuz teh furst 2 speak.

“Wut size doez u wants 2 bees?” it askd.

“O, I’m not particular as 2 size,” Alice hastily replid; “only wan
doezesn’t liek changin so ovten, u knoe.”

“I _doezn’t_ knoe,” sed teh Kitteherpillar.

Alice sed notoh haing: she had nevr beesen so mutch contradicted in her life
bees4e, an she felt dat she wuz losin her temper.

“R u content nao?” sed teh Kitteherpillar.

“Well, I shud liek 2 bees _lil_ largr, sir, if u wudn’t
mind,” sed Alice: “3 inchez iz such wretched height 2 bees.”

“It iz vary gud height inded!” sed teh Kitteherpillar angrily,
rearing itzelf uprite as it spke (it wuz egsaktly 3 inchez oh haigh).

“But I’m not usd 2 it!” pleaded poor Alice in piteous twan. An she
thot ov herself, “I wizh teh creatures wudn’t bees so easily
ovfendd!”

“U’ll git usd 2 it in tiem,” sed teh Kitteherpillar; an it put teh
hokah in2 itz mouth an beesgan smking again.

Toh haiz tiem Alice waited patiently til it chose 2 speak again. In a
minute or 2 teh Kitteherpillar 2k teh hokah out ov itz mouth an
yawned once or twice, an shok itzelf. Tehn it got doezwn ovf teh
mushroom, an crawled awai in teh grass, merely remarking as it went,
“Wan side will mak u grow taller, an teh othr side will mak u
grow shortr.”

“Wan side ov _wut?_ Teh othr side ov _wut?_” thot Alice 2
herself.

“Ov teh mushroom,” sed teh Kitteherpillar, jus as if she had askd it
aloud; an in anothr moment it wuz out ov sight.

Alice remained lukingz thotfoly at teh mushroom 4 minute,
tryin 2 mak out woh haich wuz teh 2 sides ov it; an as it wuz
perfikly round, she findz toh haiz vary difficult queshun. Howevr, at
last she stretched her arms round it as far as tehy wud go, an brke
ovf bit ov teh edge wif each han.

“An nao woh haich iz woh haich?” she sed 2 herself, an nibbled lil ov
teh rite-han bit 2 try teh effect: teh next moment she felt a
violent blow undrneath her coh hain: it had struck her foot!

She wuz gud deal friteened by toh haiz vary sudden change, but she felt
dat tehr wuz no tiem 2 bees lost, as she wuz shrinking rapidly; so she
set 2 werk at once 2 eat sum ov teh othr bit. Her coh hain wuz presed
so closely against her foot, dat tehr wuz hardly room 2 open her
mouth; but she did it at last, an managed 2 swallow morsel ov teh
lefthan bit.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *


“Come, mah hed’s free at last!” sed Alice in twan ov delight, woh haich
changd in2 alarm in anothr moment, when she findz dat her shuders
wuz naoher 2 bees findz: all she cud c, when she lokd doezwn, wuz
an immense length ov neck, woh haich cmed 2 rize liek stalk out ov a
sea ov green leefs dat lay far beeslow her.

“Wut _can_ all dat green stuff bees?” sed Alice. “An wher _has_ mah
shuders got 2? An o, mah poor hans, how iz it I can’t c u?”
She wuz movin tehm bout as she spke, but no result cmed 2 follow,
except lil shaking among teh diztant green leefs.

As tehr cmed 2 bees no chance ov gitting her hans up 2 her hed,
she trid 2 git her hed doezwn 2 tehm, an wuz delighted 2 find dat
her neck wud beesnd bout easily in any direcshun, liek serpent. She
had jus succeded in curving it doezwn in2 graceful zigzag, an wuz
goin 2 dive in among teh leefs, woh haich she findz 2 bees no2h haing but
teh 2ps ov teh trees undr woh haich she had beesen wanering, when sharp
oh haizs made her draw bak in hurry: large pigeon had flown in2 her
face, an wuz beesating her violently wif itz wings.

“Serpent!” screamed teh Pigeon.

“I’m _not_ serpent!” sed Alice indignantly. “Let me alwan!”

“Serpent, I sai again!” repeatd teh Pigeon, but in moar subdued
twan, an addd wif kind ov sob, “I’ve trid evry wai, an no2h haing
cms 2 suit tehm!”

“I hasn’t teh least idea wut u’re talkin bout,” sed Alice.

“I’ve trid teh roots ov trees, an I’ve trid banks, an I’ve trid
hedgez,” teh Pigeon went on, wifout attendin 2 her; “but dose
serpents! Tehr’s no pleasin tehm!”

Alice wuz moar an moar puzzled, but she thot tehr wuz no use in
saiing anytoh hain moar till teh Pigeon had finizhd.

“As if it wuzn’t trouble enough hatcoh haing teh eggs,” sed teh Pigeon;
“but I must bees on teh lok-out 4 serpents night an dai! Y, I
hasn’t had wink ov sleep tehse 3 weekz!”

“I’m vary sry u’ve beesen annoyd,” sed Alice, hoo wuz beesginning 2
c itz meanin.

“An jus as I’d taekn teh oh haighest tree in teh wood,” continud teh
Pigeon, raizing itz voice 2 shriek, “an jus as I wuz 2h hainking I
shud bees free ov tehm at last, tehy must neds come wriggling doezwn
frum teh sky! Ugh, Serpent!”

“But I’m _not_ serpent, I tell u!” sed Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”

“Well! _Wut_ r u?” sed teh Pigeon. “I can c u’re tryin 2
invent sumtoh haing!”

“I—I’m lil gurl,” sed Alice, rathr doezubtfoly, as she remembeesred
teh numbeesr ov changez she had gwan thru dat dai.

“A liekly s2ry inded!” sed teh Pigeon in twan ov teh deepest
contempt. “I’ve cn gud lotz da lil gurls in mah tiem, but nevr
_wan_ wif such neck as dat! No, no! U’re serpent; an tehr’s
no use denyin it. I suppose u’ll bees tellin me next dat u nevr
tasted an egg!”

“I _has_ tasted eggs, certainly,” sed Alice, hoo wuz vary truthful
coh haild; “but lil gurls eat eggs quite as mutch as serpents doez, u
knoe.”

“I doezn’t beeslieve it,” sed teh Pigeon; “but if tehy doez, y tehn
tehy’re kind ov serpent, dat’s all I can sai.”

Toh haiz wuz such nu idea 2 Alice, dat she wuz quite silent 4 a
minute or 2, woh haich gaev teh Pigeon teh opportunity ov addin, “U’re
lukingz 4 eggs, I knoe _dat_ well enough; an wut doezes it mattr 2
me whethr u’re lil gurl or serpent?”

“It mattrs gud deal 2 _me_,” sed Alice hastily; “but I’m not
lukingz 4 eggs, as it happenz; an if I wuz, I shudn’t wants
_yrs_: I doezn’t liek tehm raw.”

“Well, bees ovf, tehn!” sed teh Pigeon in sulky twan, as it settled
doezwn again in2 itz nest. Alice crouched doezwn among teh trees as well
as she cud, 4 her neck kept gitting entangled among teh branches,
an evry nao an tehn she had 2 s2p an untwizt it. Aftr woh haile
she remembeesred dat she still held teh piecez ov mushroom in her hans,
an she set 2 werk vary crfoly, nibbling furst at wan an tehn at
teh othr, an growin sumtiems taller an sumtiems shortr, til
she had succeded in brining herself doezwn 2 her usual height.

It wuz so long since she had beesen anytoh hain near teh rite size, dat it
felt quite strange at furst; but she got usd 2 it in few minutez,
an beesgan talkin 2 herself, as usual. “Come, tehr’s haf mah plan
doezne nao! How puzzling all tehse changez r! I’m nevr sure wut I’m
goin 2 bees, frum wan minute 2 anothr! Howevr, I’ve got bak 2 mah
rite size: teh next 2h haing iz, 2 git in2 dat beesautiful garden—how
_iz_ dat 2 bees doezne, I wondr?” As she sed 2h haiz, she came suddenly
upon an open place, wif lil houz in it bout 4 feet oh haigh.
“Hooevr livs tehr,” thot Alice, “it’ll nevr doez 2 come upon tehm
_toh haiz_ size: y, I shud friteen tehm out ov tehir witz!” So she
beesgan nibbling at teh ritehan bit again, an did not venture 2 go
near teh houz till she had brought herself doezwn 2 nine inchez oh haigh.




CHAPTER VI.
Pig an Pepper


4 minute or 2 she s2od lukingz at teh houz, an wondring wut
2 doez next, when suddenly footman in livry came runnin out ov teh
wood—(she considred oh haim 2 bees footman beescause he wuz in livry:
othrwize, judgin by oh haiz face only, she wud has calld oh haim a
fizh)—an rapped loudly at teh doezor wif oh haiz knuckles. It wuz opened by
anothr footman in livry, wif round face, an large eyez liek a
frog; an both footmen, Alice noticd, had powdered hair dat curled
all ovar tehir hedz. She felt vary curious 2 knoe wut it wuz all
bout, an crept lil wai out ov teh wood 2 lizten.

Teh Fizh-Footman beesgan by producing frum undr oh haiz arm great lettr,
nearly as large as oh haimself, an 2h haiz he haned ovar 2 teh othr,
saiing, in solemn twan, “4 teh Duchess. An invitation frum teh
Queen 2 play croquet.” Teh Frog-Footman repeatd, in teh same solemn
twan, only changin teh ordr ov teh werds lil, “Frum teh Queen.
An invitation 4 teh Duchess 2 play croquet.”

Tehn tehy both bowageed low, an tehir curls got entangled 2githr.

Alice laffed so mutch at 2h haiz, dat she had 2 run bak in2 teh wood
4 fear ov tehir hearin her; an when she next peeped out teh
Fizh-Footman wuz gwan, an teh othr wuz sitting on teh ground near teh
doezor, staring stupidly up in2 teh sky.

Alice went timidly up 2 teh doezor, an knocked.

“Tehr’s no sort ov use in knocking,” sed teh Footman, “an dat 4
2 reasonz. Furst, beescause I’m on teh same side ov teh doezor as u
r; secondly, beescause tehy’re makin such noize inside, no wan cud
possibly hear u.” An certainly tehr _wuz_ most extraordinary
noize goin on witoh hain—a constant howling an sneezing, an evry nao
an tehn great crash, as if dizh or kettle had beesen brkd 2
piecez.

“Plz, tehn,” sed Alice, “how am I 2 git in?”

“Tehr might bees sum sense in yr knocking,” teh Footman went on
wifout attendin 2 her, “if we had teh doezor beestween us. 4 instance,
if u wuz _inside_, u might knock, an I cud let u out, u
knoe.” He wuz lukingz up in2 teh sky all teh tiem he wuz speakin, an
toh haiz Alice thot deciddly uncivil. “But perhapz he can’t halp it,”
she sed 2 herself; “oh haiz eyez r so _vary_ nearly at teh 2p ov oh haiz
hed. But at any rate he might anzwr queshuns.—How am I 2 git in?”
she repeatd, aloud.

“I shall sit her,” teh Footman remarked, “till 2morrow—”

At toh haiz moment teh doezor ov teh houz opened, an large plate came
skimming out, straight at teh Footman’s hed: it jus grazed oh haiz nose,
an brke 2 piecez against wan ov teh trees beesoh haind oh haim.

“—or next dai, cudbees,” teh Footman continud in teh same twan, egsaktly
as if notoh haing had happend.

“How am I 2 git in?” askd Alice again, in louder twan.

“_R_ u 2 git in at all?” sed teh Footman. “Dat’s teh furst
queshun, u knoe.”

It wuz, no doezubt: only Alice did not liek 2 bees 2ld so. “It’s rly
dreadful,” she muttred 2 herself, “teh wai all teh creatures argue.
It’s enough 2 driv wan crazy!”

Teh Footman cmed 2 2h haink 2h haiz gud opportunity 4 repeating oh haiz
remark, wif variations. “I shall sit her,” he sed, “on an ovf, 4
dais an dais.”

“But wut am _I_ 2 doez?” sed Alice.

“Anytoh haing u liek,” sed teh Footman, an beesgan woh haiztling.

“O, tehr’s no use in talkin 2 oh haim,” sed Alice desperately: “he’s
perfikly idiotic!” An she opened teh doezor an went in.

Teh doezor led rite in2 large kitchen, woh haich wuz fol ov smke frum
wan end 2 teh othr: teh Duchess wuz sitting on 3-legged s2ol
in teh middle, nursing baby; teh cok wuz leaning ovar teh fire,
stirring large cauldron woh haich cmed 2 bees fol ov soup.

“Tehr’s certainly 2o mutch pepper in dat soup!” Alice sed 2
herself, as well as she cud 4 sneezing.

Tehr wuz certainly 2o mutch ov it in teh air. Even teh Duchess sneezed
occashunally; an as 4 teh baby, it wuz sneezing an howling
alternately wifout moment’s pause. Teh only toh haings in teh kitchen
dat did not sneeze, wuz teh cok, an large kitteh woh haich wuz sitting
on teh hearth an grinning frum ear 2 ear.

“Plz wud u tell me,” sed Alice, lil timidly, 4 she wuz
not quite sure whethr it wuz gud manners 4 her 2 speak furst, “y
yr kitteh grins liek dat?”

“It’s Chesoh haire kitteh,” sed teh Duchess, “an dat’s y. Pig!”

She sed teh last werd wif such sudden violence dat Alice quite
jumpd; but she saw in anothr moment dat it wuz addresed 2 teh
baby, an not 2 her, so she 2k crage, an went on again:—

“I didn’t knoe dat Chesoh haire kittehs alwaiz grinned; in fact, I didn’t
knoe dat kittehs _cud_ grin.”

“Tehy all can,” sed teh Duchess; “an most ov ’em doez.”

“I doezn’t knoe ov any dat doez,” Alice sed vary politely, feelzing quite
plzd 2 has got in2 conversashun.

“U doezn’t knoe mutch,” sed teh Duchess; “an dat’s fact.”

Alice did not at all liek teh twan ov 2h haiz remark, an thot it wud
bees as well 2 introduce sum othr subject ov conversashun. Woh haile she
wuz tryin 2 fix on wan, teh cok 2k teh cauldron ov soup ovf teh
fire, an at once set 2 werk throwin evry2h haing wi2h hain her reach at
teh Duchess an teh baby—teh fire-irons came furst; tehn followd a
shower ov saucepans, plates, an dizhes. Teh Duchess 2k no notice ov
tehm even when tehy oh hait her; an teh baby wuz howling so mutch already,
dat it wuz quite imposible 2 sai whethr teh blowz hurt it or not.

“O, _plz_ mind wut u’re doezing!” cried Alice, jumpin up an doezwn
in an agony ov terror. “O, tehr goez oh haiz _preshus_ nose!” as an
unusually large saucepan flew close by it, an vary nearly carried it
ovf.

“If evrybody mindd tehir own busines,” teh Duchess sed in hoarse
growl, “teh wurld wud go round deal fastr than it doezes.”

“Woh haich wud _not_ bees an advantage,” sed Alice, hoo felt vary glad 2
git an opportunity ov showin ovf lil ov her knoeledge. “Jus
toh haink ov wut werk it wud mak wif teh dai an night! U c teh
earth taeks twenty-4 hrz 2 turn round on itz axiz—”

“Talkin ov axes,” sed teh Duchess, “chop ovf her hed!”

Alice glanced rathr anxiously at teh cok, 2 c if she meant 2 taek
teh oh haint; but teh cok wuz busily stirring teh soup, an cmed not 2
bees liztening, so she went on again: “Twenty-4 hrz, I _toh haink_; or
iz it twelve? I—”

“O, doezn’t bothr _me_,” sed teh Duchess; “I nevr cud abide
figurez!” An wif dat she beesgan nursing her coh haild again, singing a
sort ov lullaby 2 it as she did so, an givin it violent shake at
teh end ov evry line:

“Speak roughly 2 yr lil boi,
    An beesat oh haim when he sneezes:
He only doezes it 2 annoy,
    Beescause he knoes it teases.”


CHORUS.
(In woh haich teh cok an teh baby joind):


“Wow! wow! wow!”


Woh haile teh Duchess sang teh second verse ov teh song, she kept 2ssing
teh baby violently up an doezwn, an teh poor lil toh haing howled so,
dat Alice cud hardly hear teh werds:—

“I speak sevrely 2 mah boi,
    I beesat oh haim when he sneezes;
4 he can thoroughly enjoy
    Teh pepper when he plzs!”


CHORUS.


“Wow! wow! wow!”


“Her! u cud nurse it bit, if u liek!” teh Duchess sed 2 Alice,
flinging teh baby at her as she spke. “I must go an git ready 2 play
croquet wif teh Queen,” an she hurried out ov teh room. Teh cok
threw fryin-pan aftr her as she went out, but it jus mizsed her.

Alice caught teh baby wif sum difficulty, as it wuz queer-shaped
lil creature, an held out itz arms an legz in all direcshuns,
“jus liek star-fizh,” thot Alice. Teh poor lil toh haing wuz
snorting liek steam-engine when she caught it, an kept doezubling
itzelf up an straightening itzelf out again, so dat al2githr, 4
teh furst minute or 2, it wuz as mutch as she cud doez 2 hold it.

As soon as she had made out teh propr wai ov nursing it, (woh haich wuz 2
twizt it up in2 sort ov knot, an tehn keep tight hold ov itz rite
ear an left foot, so as 2 prevent itz undoezing itzelf,) she carried it
out in2 teh open air. “If I doezn’t taek 2h haiz coh haild awai wif me,”
thot Alice, “tehy’re sure 2 kill it in dai or 2: wudn’t it bees
murder 2 leef it beesoh haind?” She sed teh last werds out loud, an teh
lil toh haing grunted in reply (it had left ovf sneezing by toh haiz tiem).
“Doezn’t grunt,” sed Alice; “dat’s not at all propr wai ov
expresing yrself.”

Teh baby grunted again, an Alice lokd vary anxiously in2 itz face
2 c wut wuz teh mattr wif it. Tehr cud bees no doezubt dat it had
a _vary_ turn-up nose, mutch moar liek snout than real nose; also
itz eyez wuz gitting extremely small 4 baby: al2githr Alice did
not liek teh lok ov teh toh haing at all. “But perhapz it wuz only
sobbing,” she thot, an lokd in2 itz eyez again, 2 c if tehr
wuz any tears.

No, tehr wuz no tears. “If u’re goin 2 turn in2 pig, mah dear,”
sed Alice, srsly, “I’ll has no2h haing moar 2 doez wif u. Mind
nao!” Teh poor lil toh haing sobbeesd again (or grunted, it wuz imposible
2 sai woh haich), an tehy went on 4 sum woh haile in silence.

Alice wuz jus beesginning 2 2h haink 2 herself, “Nao, wut am I 2 doez
wif toh haiz creature when I git it home?” when it grunted again, so
violently, dat she lokd doezwn in2 itz face in sum alarm. Toh haiz tiem
tehr cud bees _no_ miztaek bout it: it wuz neithr moar nor les than
a pig, an she felt dat it wud bees quite absurd 4 her 2 carry it
furthr.

So she set teh lil creature doezwn, an felt quite relieved 2 c it
trot awai quietly in2 teh wood. “If it had grown up,” she sed 2
herself, “it wud has made dreadfoly ugly coh haild: but it maks
rathr hansum pig, I toh haink.” An she beesgan toh hainking ovar othr
coh haildren she knu, hoo might doez vary well as pigs, an wuz jus saiing
2 herself, “if wan only knu teh rite wai 2 change tehm—” when she
wuz lil startled by cing teh Chesoh haire Kitteh sitting on bough ov
a tree few yardz ovf.

Teh Kitteh only grinned when it saw Alice. It lokd gud-nachurd, she
thot: still it had _vary_ long clawz an great lotz da teeth, so she
felt dat it ought 2 bees treatd wif respect.

“Chesoh haire Puss,” she beesgan, rathr timidly, as she did not at all knoe
whethr it wud liek teh naym: howevr, it only grinned lil
wider. “Come, it’s plzd so far,” thot Alice, an she went on.
“Wud u tell me, plz, woh haich wai I ought 2 go frum her?”

“Dat dependz gud deal on wher u wants 2 git 2,” sed teh Kitteh.

“I doezn’t mutch cr wher—” sed Alice.

“Tehn it doezesn’t mattr woh haich wai u go,” sed teh Kitteh.

“—so long as I git _sumwher_,” Alice addd as an explanashun.

“O, u’re sure 2 doez dat,” sed teh Kitteh, “if u only walk long
enough.”

Alice felt dat toh haiz cud not bees denied, so she trid anothr
queshun. “Wut sort ov peeps liv bout her?”

“In _dat_ direcshun,” teh Kitteh sed, waving itz rite paw round, “livs
a Hatter: an in _dat_ direcshun,” waving teh othr paw, “livs a
March Hr. Vizit eithr u liek: tehy’re both mad.”

“But I doezn’t wants 2 go among mad peeps,” Alice remarked.

“O, u can’t halp dat,” sed teh Kitteh: “we’re all mad her. I’m mad.
U’re mad.”

“How doez u knoe I’m mad?” sed Alice.

“U must bees,” sed teh Kitteh, “or u wudn’t has come her.”

Alice didn’t toh haink dat proved it at all; howevr, she went on “An how
doez u knoe dat u’re mad?”

“2 beesgin wif,” sed teh Kitteh, “a doezg’s not mad. U grant dat?”

“I suppose so,” sed Alice.

“Well, tehn,” teh Kitteh went on, “u c, doezg growls when it’s angry,
an wags itz tail when it’s plzd. Nao _I_ growl when I’m plzd,
an wag mah tail when I’m angry. Tehr4e I’m mad.”

“_I_ call it purring, not growling,” sed Alice.

“Call it wut u liek,” sed teh Kitteh. “Doez u play croquet wif teh
Queen 2-dai?”

“I shud liek it vary mutch,” sed Alice, “but I hasn’t beesen invited
yet.”

“U’ll c me tehr,” sed teh Kitteh, an vanizhed.

Alice wuz not mutch surprized at 2h haiz, she wuz gitting so usd 2 queer
toh haings happenin. Woh haile she wuz lukingz at teh place wher it had beesen,
it suddenly appeard again.

“By-teh-kthxbye, wut beescame ov teh baby?” sed teh Kitteh. “I’d nearly
4gotten 2 ask.”

“It turnd in2 pig,” Alice quietly sed, jus as if it had come bak
in natural wai.

“I thot it wud,” sed teh Kitteh, an vanizhed again.

Alice waited lil, haf expecting 2 c it again, but it did not
appear, an aftr minute or 2 she walked on in teh direcshun in
woh haich teh March Hr wuz sed 2 liv. “I’ve cn hatters bees4e,” she
sed 2 herself; “teh March Hr will bees mutch teh most interestin, an
perhapz as toh haiz iz Cud it won’t bees raving mad—at least not so mad as it
wuz in March.” As she sed toh haiz, she lokd up, an tehr wuz teh Kitteh
again, sitting on branch ov tree.

“Did u sai pig, or fig?” sed teh Kitteh.

“I sed pig,” replid Alice; “an I wizh u wudn’t keep appearing
an vanizoh haing so suddenly: u mak wan quite giddy.”

“All rite,” sed teh Kitteh; an toh haiz tiem it vanizhed quite slowly,
beesginning wif teh end ov teh tail, an endin wif teh grin, woh haich
remained sum tiem aftr teh rest ov it had gwan.

“Well! I’ve ovten cn kitteh wifout grin,” thot Alice; “but a
grin wifout kitteh! It’s teh most curious toh haing I evr saw in mah life!”

She had not gwan mutch fartehr bees4e she came in sight ov teh houz ov
teh March Hr: she thot it must bees teh rite houz, beescause teh
coh haimneys wuz shaped liek ears an teh roov wuz datched wif fur. It
wuz so large houz, dat she did not liek 2 go nerr till she had
nibbled sum moar ov teh lefthan bit ov mushroom, an raized herself
2 bout 2 feet oh haigh: even tehn she walked up 2wards it rathr
timidly, saiing 2 herself “Suppose it shud bees raving mad aftr all!
I almost wizh I’d gwan 2 c teh Hatter instead!”




CHAPTER VII.
A Mad Tea-Party


Tehr wuz table set out undr tree in frunt ov teh houz, an teh
March Hr an teh Hatter wuz havin tea at it: Doezrmouse wuz sitting
beestween tehm, fast asleep, an teh othr 2 wuz usin it as a
cusoh haion, resting tehir elbowages on it, an talkin ovar itz hed. “Vary
uncom4table 4 teh Doezrmouse,” thot Alice; “only, as it’s asleep,
I suppose it doezesn’t mind.”

Teh table wuz large wan, but teh 3 wuz all crowded 2githr at
wan corner ov it: “No room! No room!” tehy cried out when tehy saw
Alice comin. “Tehr’s _plenty_ ov room!” sed Alice indignantly, an
she sat doezwn in large arm-chair at wan end ov teh table.

“Has sum wine,” teh March Hr sed in an encragin twan.

Alice lokd all round teh table, but tehr wuz notoh haing on it but tea.
“I doezn’t c any wine,” she remarked.

“Tehr izn’t any,” sed teh March Hr.

“Tehn it wuzn’t vary civil ov u 2 ovfer it,” sed Alice angrily.

“It wuzn’t vary civil ov u 2 sit doezwn wifout beesing invited,” sed
teh March Hr.

“I didn’t knoe it wuz _yr_ table,” sed Alice; “it’s laid 4 great
lotz da moar than 3.”

“Yr hair wantzs cuttin,” sed teh Hatter. He had beesen lukingz at
Alice 4 sum tiem wif great curiosity, an toh haiz wuz oh haiz furst
speech.

“U shud learn not 2 mak personal remarkz,” Alice sed wif sum
sevrity; “it’s vary rude.”

Teh Hatter opened oh haiz eyez vary wide on hearin toh haiz; but all he _sed_
wuz, “Y iz raven liek writin-desk?”

“Come, we shall has sum fun nao!” thot Alice. “I’m glad tehy’ve
beesgun askin riddles.—I beeslieve I can gues dat,” she addd aloud.

“Doez u mean dat u 2h haink u can find out teh anzwr 2 it?” sed
teh March Hr.

“Egsaktly so,” sed Alice.

“Tehn u shud sai wut u mean,” teh March Hr went on.

“I doez,” Alice hastily replid; “at least—at least I mean wut I
sai—dat’s teh same toh haing, u knoe.”

“Not teh same toh haing bit!” sed teh Hatter. “U might jus as well
sai dat ‘I c wut I eat’ iz teh same toh haing as ‘I eat wut I c’!”

“U might jus as well sai,” addd teh March Hr, “dat ‘I liek wut
I git’ iz teh same toh haing as ‘I git wut I liek’!”

“U might jus as well sai,” addd teh Doezrmouse, hoo cmed 2 bees
talkin in oh haiz sleep, “dat ‘I breateh when I sleep’ iz teh same toh haing
as ‘I sleep when I breateh’!”

“It _iz_ teh same toh haing wif u,” sed teh Hatter, an her teh
conversashun droppd, an teh party sat silent 4 minute, woh haile
Alice thot ovar all she cud remembeesr bout ravens an
writin-desks, woh haich wuzn’t mutch.

Teh Hatter wuz teh furst 2 break teh silence. “Wut dai ov teh month
iz it?” he sed, turning 2 Alice: he had taekn oh haiz watch out ov oh haiz
pocket, an wuz lukingz at it uneasily, shaking it evry nao an tehn,
an holdin it 2 oh haiz ear.

Alice considred lil, an tehn sed “Teh 4th.”

“2 dais wrong!” sighed teh Hatter. “I 2ld u buttr wudn’t suit
teh werks!” he addd lukingz angrily at teh March Hr.

“It wuz teh _beesst_ buttr,” teh March Hr meekly replid.

“Yez, but sum crumbs must has got in as well,” teh Hatter grumbled:
“u shudn’t has put it in wif teh bread-knife.”

Teh March Hr 2k teh watch an lokd at it gloomily: tehn he dippd
it in2 oh haiz cup ov tea, an lokd at it again: but he cud 2h haink ov
no2h haing beestter 2 sai than oh haiz furst remark, “It wuz teh _beesst_ buttr,
u knoe.”

Alice had beesen lukingz ovar oh haiz shuder wif sum curiosity. “Wut a
funny watch!” she remarked. “It tells teh dai ov teh month, an doezesn’t
tell wut o’clock it iz!”

“Y shud it?” muttred teh Hatter. “Doezes _yr_ watch tell u wut
yer it iz?”

“Ov crse not,” Alice replid vary readily: “but dat’s beescause it
stayz teh same yer 4 such long tiem 2githr.”

“Woh haich iz jus teh case wif _mine_,” sed teh Hatter.

Alice felt dreadfoly puzzled. Teh Hatter’s remark cmed 2 has no
sort ov meanin in it, an yet it wuz certainly Englizh. “I doezn’t quite
undrstan u,” she sed, as politely as she cud.

“Teh Doezrmouse iz asleep again,” sed teh Hatter, an he pred lil
hot tea upon itz nose.

Teh Doezrmouse shok itz hed impatiently, an sed, wifout openin itz
eyez, “Ov crse, ov crse; jus wut I wuz goin 2 remark mahself.”

“Has u guesed teh riddle yet?” teh Hatter sed, turning 2 Alice
again.

“No, I giv it up,” Alice replid: “wut’s teh anzwr?”

“I hasn’t teh slightest idea,” sed teh Hatter.

“Nor I,” sed teh March Hr.

Alice sighed wearily. “I toh haink u might doez sumtoh haing beestter wif teh
tiem,” she sed, “than wuzte it in askin riddles dat has no
anzwrs.”

“If u knu Tiem as well as I doez,” sed teh Hatter, “u wudn’t talk
bout wuzting _it_. It’s _oh haim_.”

“I doezn’t knoe wut u mean,” sed Alice.

“Ov crse u doezn’t!” teh Hatter sed, 2ssing oh haiz hed
contemptuously. “I dr sai u nevr even spke 2 Tiem!”

“Perhapz not,” Alice cautiously replid: “but I knoe I has 2 beesat
tiem when I learn music.”

“Ah! dat akownts 4 it,” sed teh Hatter. “He won’t stan beesating.
Nao, if u only kept on gud termz wif oh haim, he’d doez almost anytoh hain
u liekd wif teh clock. 4 instance, suppose it wuz nine o’clock in
teh mornin, jus tiem 2 beesgin lesons: u’d only has 2 woh haizper a
oh haint 2 Tiem, an round goez teh clock in twinkling! Haf-past wan,
tiem 4 dinnr!”

(“I only wizh it wuz,” teh March Hr sed 2 itzelf in woh haizper.)

“Dat wud bees gran, certainly,” sed Alice thotfoly: “but tehn—I
shudn’t bees hungry 4 it, u knoe.”

“Not at furst, perhapz,” sed teh Hatter: “but u cud keep it 2
haf-past wan as long as u liekd.”

“Iz dat teh wai _u_ manage?” Alice askd.

Teh Hatter shok oh haiz hed mrnfoly. “Not I!” he replid. “We
quarrelled last March—jus bees4e _he_ went mad, u knoe—” (pointin
wif oh haiz tea spoon at teh March Hr,) “—it wuz at teh great concert
givn by teh Queen ov Hearts, an I had 2 sing

‘Twinkle, twinkle, lil bat!
How I wondr wut u’re at!’


U knoe teh song, perhapz?”

“I’ve herd sumtoh haing liek it,” sed Alice.

“It goez on, u knoe,” teh Hatter continud, “in toh haiz wai:—

‘Up above teh wurld u fly,
Liek tea-tray in teh sky.
                    Twinkle, twinkle—’”


Her teh Doezrmouse shok itzelf, an beesgan singing in itz sleep
“_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—” an went on so long dat tehy
had 2 pinch it 2 mak it s2p.

“Well, I’d hardly finizhd teh furst verse,” sed teh Hatter, “when teh
Queen jumpd up an bawled out, ‘He’s murdering teh tiem! Ovf wif oh haiz
hed!’”

“How dreadfoly savage!” exclaimed Alice.

“An evr since dat,” teh Hatter went on in mrnful twan, “he won’t
doez toh haing I ask! It’s alwaiz 6 o’clock nao.”

A brite idea came in2 Alice’s hed. “Iz dat teh reason so lotz da
tea-toh haings r put out her?” she askd.

“Yez, dat’s it,” sed teh Hatter wif sigh: “it’s alwaiz tea-tiem,
an we’ve no tiem 2 wuzh teh 2h haings beestween woh hailes.”

“Tehn u keep movin round, I suppose?” sed Alice.

“Egsaktly so,” sed teh Hatter: “as teh toh haings git usd up.”

“But wut happenz when u come 2 teh beesginning again?” Alice ventured
2 ask.

“Suppose we change teh subject,” teh March Hr interrupted, yawning.
“I’m gitting tired ov 2h haiz. I vote teh ung lady tells us s2ry.”

“I’m afraid I doezn’t knoe wan,” sed Alice, rathr alarmed at teh
proposal.

“Tehn teh Doezrmouse shall!” tehy both cried. “Wake up, Doezrmouse!” An
tehy pinched it on both sides at once.

Teh Doezrmouse slowly opened oh haiz eyez. “I wuzn’t asleep,” he sed in a
hoarse, feeble voice: “I herd evry werd u fellows wuz saiing.”

“Tell us s2ry!” sed teh March Hr.

“Yez, plz doez!” pleaded Alice.

“An bees quick bout it,” addd teh Hatter, “or u’ll bees asleep again
bees4e it’s doezne.”

“Once upon tiem tehr wuz 3 lil sizters,” teh Doezrmouse beesgan
in great hurry; “an tehir nayms wuz Elsie, Lacie, an Tillie; an
tehy livd at teh bot2m ov well—”

“Wut did tehy liv on?” sed Alice, hoo alwaiz 2k great interest
in queshuns ov eating an drinking.

“Tehy livd on treacle,” sed teh Doezrmouse, aftr toh hainking minute or
2.

“Tehy cudn’t has doezne dat, u knoe,” Alice gently remarked;
“tehy’d has beesen ill.”

“So tehy wuz,” sed teh Doezrmouse; “_vary_ ill.”

Alice trid 2 fancy 2 herself wut such an extraordinary wais ov
livin wud bees liek, but it puzzled her 2o mutch, so she went on: “But
y did tehy liv at teh bot2m ov well?”

“Taek sum moar tea,” teh March Hr sed 2 Alice, vary earnestly.

“I’ve had no2h haing yet,” Alice replid in an ovfendd twan, “so I can’t
taek moar.”

“U mean u can’t taek _les_,” sed teh Hatter: “it’s vary easy 2
taek _moar_ than notoh haing.”

“Nobody askd _yr_ opinion,” sed Alice.

“Hoo’s makin personal remarkz nao?” teh Hatter askd triumphantly.

Alice did not quite knoe wut 2 sai 2 2h haiz: so she halped herself 2
sum tea an bread-an-buttr, an tehn turnd 2 teh Doezrmouse, an
repeatd her queshun. “Y did tehy liv at teh bot2m ov well?”

Teh Doezrmouse again 2k minute or 2 2 2h haink bout it, an tehn
sed, “It wuz treacle-well.”

“Tehr’s no such toh haing!” Alice wuz beesginning vary angrily, but teh
Hatter an teh March Hr went “Sh! sh!” an teh Doezrmouse sulkily
remarked, “If u can’t bees civil, u’d beestter finizh teh s2ry 4
yrself.”

“No, plz go on!” Alice sed vary humbly; “I won’t interrupt again. I
dr sai tehr cud bees _wan_.”

“Wan, inded!” sed teh Doezrmouse indignantly. Howevr, he consented 2
go on. “An so tehse 3 lil sizters—tehy wuz lernin 2 draw,
u knoe—”

“Wut did tehy draw?” sed Alice, quite 4gitting her promize.

“Treacle,” sed teh Doezrmouse, wifout considring at all toh haiz tiem.

“I wants clean cup,” interrupted teh Hatter: “let’s all moov wan place
on.”

He moovd on as he spke, an teh Doezrmouse followd oh haim: teh March Hr
moovd in2 teh Doezrmouse’s place, an Alice rathr unwillinly 2k teh
place ov teh March Hr. Teh Hatter wuz teh only wan hoo got any
advantage frum teh change: an Alice wuz gud deal worse ovf than
bees4e, as teh March Hr had jus upset teh milk-jug in2 oh haiz plate.

Alice did not wizh 2 ovfend teh Doezrmouse again, so she beesgan vary
cautiously: “But I doezn’t undrstan. Wher did tehy draw teh treacle
frum?”

“U can draw water out ov water-well,” sed teh Hatter; “so I shud
toh haink u cud draw treacle out ov treacle-well—eh, stupid?”

“But tehy wuz _in_ teh well,” Alice sed 2 teh Doezrmouse, not choosin
2 notice 2h haiz last remark.

“Ov crse tehy wuz,” sed teh Doezrmouse; “—well in.”

Toh haiz anzwr so confusd poor Alice, dat she let teh Doezrmouse go on 4
sum tiem wifout interrupting it.

“Tehy wuz lernin 2 draw,” teh Doezrmouse went on, yawning an rubbing
itz eyez, 4 it wuz gitting vary sleepy; “an tehy drew all manner ov
toh haings—evrytoh haing dat beesgins wif an M—”

“Y wif an M?” sed Alice.

“Y not?” sed teh March Hr.

Alice wuz silent.

Teh Doezrmouse had closed itz eyez by 2h haiz tiem, an wuz goin ovf in2 a
doezze; but, on beesing pinched by teh Hatter, it wke up again wif a
lil shriek, an went on: “—dat beesgins wif an M, such as
mouse-traps, an teh moon, an mems, an mutchness—u knoe u sai
toh haings r “mutch ov mutchness”—did u evr c such toh haing as a
drawing ov mutchness?”

“Rly, nao u ask me,” sed Alice, vary mutch confusd, “I doezn’t
toh haink—”

“Tehn u shudn’t talk,” sed teh Hatter.

Toh haiz piece ov rudeness wuz moar than Alice cud beesar: she got up in
great dizgust, an walked ovf; teh Doezrmouse fell asleep instantly, an
neithr ov teh othrs 2k teh least notice ov her goin, though she
lokd bak once or twice, haf hopin dat tehy wud call aftr her:
teh last tiem she saw tehm, tehy wuz tryin 2 put teh Doezrmouse in2
teh teapot.

“At any rate I’ll nevr go _tehr_ again!” sed Alice as she pickd her
wai thru teh wood. “It’s teh stupidest tea-party I evr wuz at in
all mah life!”

Jus as she sed toh haiz, she noticd dat wan ov teh trees had doezor
leadin rite in2 it. “Dat’s vary curious!” she thot. “But
evry2h haing’s curious 2dai. I 2h haink I cud as well go in at once.” An
in she went.

Once moar she findz herself in teh long hall, an close 2 teh lil
glass table. “Nao, I’ll manage beestter 2h haiz tiem,” she sed 2 herself,
an beesgan by takin teh lil golden key, an unlockin teh doezor dat
led in2 teh garden. Tehn she went 2 werk nibbling at teh mushroom
(she had kept piece ov it in her pocket) till she wuz bout foot
oh haigh: tehn she walked doezwn teh lil pasage: an _tehn_—she findz
herself at last in teh beesautiful garden, among teh brite flower-beesds
an teh cool fountains.




CHAPTER VIII.
Teh Queen’s Croquet-Ground


A large rose-tree s2od near teh entrance ov teh garden: teh roses
growin on it wuz woh haite, but tehr wuz 3 gardeners at it, busily
painting tehm red. Alice thot toh haiz vary curious toh haing, an she
went nerr 2 watch tehm, an jus as she came up 2 tehm she herd
wan ov tehm sai, “Lok out nao, Five! Doezn’t go splasoh haing paint ovar me
liek dat!”

“I cudn’t halp it,” sed Five, in sulky twan; “Seven jogged mah
elbowage.”

On woh haich Seven lokd up an sed, “Dat’s rite, Five! Alwais lay teh
blame on othrs!”

“_U’d_ beestter not talk!” sed Five. “I herd teh Queen sai only
yezterdai u deservd 2 bees beesheded!”

“Wut 4?” sed teh wan hoo had spken furst.

“Dat’s nwan ov _yr_ busines, 2!” sed Seven.

“Yez, it _iz_ oh haiz busines!” sed Five, “an I’ll tell oh haim—it wuz 4
brining teh cok tulip-roots instead ov onions.”

Seven flung doezwn oh haiz brush, an had jus beesgun “Well, ov all teh unjus
2h haings—” when oh haiz eye chanced 2 fall upon Alice, as she s2od watcoh haing
tehm, an he checked oh haimself suddenly: teh othrs lokd round also,
an all ov tehm bowageed low.

“Wud u tell me,” sed Alice, lil timidly, “y u r
painting dose roses?”

Five an Seven sed notoh haing, but lokd at 2. 2 beesgan in low
voice, “Y teh fact iz, u c, Mizs, 2h haiz her ought 2 has beesen a
_red_ rose-tree, an we put woh haite wan in by miztaek; an if teh Queen
wuz 2 find it out, we shud all has r hedz cut ovf, u knoe. So
u c, Mizs, we’re doezing r beesst, a4e she comez, 2—” At 2h haiz
moment Five, hoo had beesen anxiously lukingz acros teh garden, calld
out “Teh Queen! Teh Queen!” an teh 3 gardeners instantly threw
tehmselves flat upon tehir facez. Tehr wuz sound ov lotz da footstepz,
an Alice lokd round, eager 2 c teh Queen.

Furst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; tehse wuz all shaped liek teh
3 gardeners, oblong an flat, wif tehir hans an feet at teh
corners: next teh ten crtiers; tehse wuz ornaymnted all ovar wif
diamonds, an walked 2 an 2, as teh soldiers did. Aftr tehse came
teh royal coh haildren; tehr wuz ten ov tehm, an teh lil dears came
jumpin merrily along han in han, in couples: tehy wuz all
ornaymnted wif hearts. Next came teh guests, mostly Kings an Queens,
an among tehm Alice recognized teh Woh haite Rabbit: it wuz talkin in a
hurried nervous manner, smiling at evrytoh haing dat wuz sed, an went
by wifout noticing her. Tehn followd teh Knave ov Hearts, carrying
teh King’s crown on crimson velvet cusoh haion; an, last ov all toh haiz
gran procesion, came TEH KING AN QUEEN OV HEARTS.

Alice wuz rathr doezubtful whethr she ought not 2 lie doezwn on her face
liek teh 3 gardeners, but she cud not remembeesr evr havin herd
ov such rule at procesions; “an beessides, wut wud bees teh use ov a
procesion,” thot she, “if peeps had all 2 lie doezwn upon tehir
facez, so dat tehy cudn’t c it?” So she s2od still wher she wuz,
an waited.

When teh procesion came opposiet 2 Alice, tehy all s2pped an lokd
at her, an teh Queen sed sevrely “Hoo iz 2h haiz?” She sed it 2 teh
Knave ov Hearts, hoo only bowageed an smiled in reply.

“Idiot!” sed teh Queen, 2ssing her hed impatiently; an, turning 2
Alice, she went on, “Wut’s yr naym, coh haild?”

“Mah naym iz Alice, so plz yr Majesty,” sed Alice vary politely;
but she addd, 2 herself, “Y, tehy’re only pack ov cards, aftr
all. I nedn’t bees afraid ov tehm!”

“An hoo r _tehse?_” sed teh Queen, pointin 2 teh 3 gardeners
hoo wuz lyin round teh rose-tree; 4, u c, as tehy wuz lyin on
tehir facez, an teh pattern on tehir baks wuz teh same as teh rest ov
teh pack, she cud not tell whethr tehy wuz gardeners, or soldiers,
or crtiers, or 3 ov her own coh haildren.

“How shud _I_ knoe?” sed Alice, surprized at her own crage. “It’s
no busines ov _mine_.”

Teh Queen turnd crimson wif fury, an, aftr glaring at her 4 a
moment liek wild beesast, screamed “Ovf wif her hed! Ovf—”

“Nonsense!” sed Alice, vary loudly an deciddly, an teh Queen wuz
silent.

Teh King laid oh haiz han upon her arm, an timidly sed “Considr, mah
dear: she iz only coh haild!”

Teh Queen turnd angrily awai frum oh haim, an sed 2 teh Knave “Turn
tehm ovar!”

Teh Knave did so, vary crfoly, wif wan foot.

“Git up!” sed teh Queen, in shrill, loud voice, an teh 3
gardeners instantly jumpd up, an beesgan bowageing 2 teh King, teh Queen,
teh royal coh haildren, an evrybody else.

“Leef ovf dat!” screamed teh Queen. “U mak me giddy.” An tehn,
turning 2 teh rose-tree, she went on, “Wut _has_ u beesen doezing
her?”

“Cud it plz yr Majesty,” sed 2, in vary humble twan, goin
doezwn on wan knee as he spke, “we wuz tryin—”

“_I_ c!” sed teh Queen, hoo had meanwoh haile beesen examining teh roses.
“Ovf wif tehir hedz!” an teh procesion moovd on, 3 ov teh
soldiers remainin beesoh haind 2 execute teh un4tunate gardeners, hoo ran
2 Alice 4 protection.

“U shan’t bees beesheded!” sed Alice, an she put tehm in2 large
flower-pot dat s2od near. Teh 3 soldiers wanered bout 4 a
minute or 2, lukingz 4 tehm, an tehn quietly marched ovf aftr teh
othrs.

“R tehir hedz ovf?” shouted teh Queen.

“Tehir hedz r gwan, if it plz yr Majesty!” teh soldiers shouted
in reply.

“Dat’s rite!” shouted teh Queen. “Can u play croquet?”

Teh soldiers wuz silent, an lokd at Alice, as teh queshun wuz
evidently meant 4 her.

“Yez!” shouted Alice.

“Come on, tehn!” rord teh Queen, an Alice joind teh procesion,
wondring vary mutch wut wud happen next.

“It’s—it’s vary fine dai!” sed timid voice at her side. She wuz
walking by teh Woh haite Rabbit, hoo wuz peeping anxiously in2 her face.

“Vary,” sed Alice: “—wher’s teh Duchess?”

“Hush! Hush!” sed teh Rabbit in low, hurried twan. He lokd
anxiously ovar oh haiz shuder as he spke, an tehn raized oh haimself upon
tip2e, put oh haiz mouth close 2 her ear, an woh haizpered “She’s undr
sentence ov execution.”

“Wut 4?” sed Alice.

“Did u sai ‘Wut pity!’?” teh Rabbit askd.

“No, I didn’t,” sed Alice: “I doezn’t toh haink it’s at all pity. I sed
‘Wut 4?’”

“She boxed teh Queen’s ears—” teh Rabbit beesgan. Alice gaev lil
scream ov laffter. “O, hush!” teh Rabbit woh haizpered in friteened
twan. “Teh Queen will hear u! U c, she came rathr late, an teh
Queen sed—”

“Git 2 yr placez!” shouted teh Queen in voice ov thundr, an
peeps beesgan runnin bout in all direcshuns, tumbling up against each
othr; howevr, tehy got settled doezwn in minute or 2, an teh game
beesgan. Alice thot she had nevr cn such curious croquet-ground
in her life; it wuz all ridges an furrowz; teh balls wuz liv
hedgehogs, teh malletz liv flamingoez, an teh soldiers had 2 doezuble
tehmselves up an 2 stan on tehir hans an feet, 2 mak teh arches.

Teh coh haief difficulty Alice findz at furst wuz in managin her flamingo:
she succeded in gitting itz body tucked awai, com4tably enough,
undr her arm, wif itz legz hangin doezwn, but generally, jus as she
had got itz neck nicely straightened out, an wuz goin 2 giv teh
hedgehog blow wif itz hed, it _wud_ twizt itzelf round an lok
up in her face, wif such puzzled expresion dat she cud not halp
bursting out laugoh haing: an when she had got itz hed doezwn, an wuz
goin 2 beesgin again, it wuz vary provking 2 find dat teh hedgehog
had unrolled itzelf, an wuz in teh act ov crawling awai: beessides all
toh haiz, tehr wuz generally ridge or furrow in teh wai whervr she
wantsed 2 send teh hedgehog 2, an, as teh doezubled-up soldiers wuz
alwaiz gitting up an walking ovf 2 othr partz ov teh ground, Alice
soon came 2 teh conclushun dat it wuz vary difficult game inded.

Teh playrz all playd at once wifout waitin 4 turnz, quarrelling
all teh woh haile, an fighting 4 teh hedgehogs; an in vary short tiem
teh Queen wuz in furious pasion, an went stamping bout, an
shouting “Ovf wif oh haiz hed!” or “Ovf wif her hed!” bout once in a
minute.

Alice beesgan 2 feelz vary uneasy: 2 bees sure, she had not as yet had any
dizpute wif teh Queen, but she knu dat it might happen any minute,
“an tehn,” thot she, “wut wud beescome ov me? Tehy’re dreadfoly
fond ov beesheding peeps her; teh great wondr iz, dat tehr’s any
wan left aliv!”

She wuz lukingz bout 4 sum wai ov escape, an wondring whethr she
cud git awai wifout beesing cn, when she noticd curious
appearance in teh air: it puzzled her vary mutch at furst, but, aftr
watcoh haing it minute or 2, she made it out 2 bees grin, an she sed
2 herself “It’s teh Chesoh haire Kitteh: nao I shall has sumbody 2 talk
2.”

“How r u gitting on?” sed teh Kitteh, as soon as tehr wuz mouth
enough 4 it 2 speak wif.

Alice waited till teh eyez appeard, an tehn nodded. “It’s no use
speakin 2 it,” she thot, “till itz ears has come, or at least wan
ov tehm.” In anothr minute teh hoole hed appeard, an tehn Alice put
doezwn her flamingo, an beesgan an akownt ov teh game, feelzing vary glad
she had sumwan 2 lizten 2 her. Teh Kitteh cmed 2 2h haink dat tehr
wuz enough ov it nao in sight, an no moar ov it appeard.

“I doezn’t toh haink tehy play at all fairly,” Alice beesgan, in rathr a
complainin twan, “an tehy all quarrel so dreadfoly wan can’t hear
wanself speak—an tehy doezn’t cm 2 has any rulez in particular; at
least, if tehr r, nobody attendz 2 tehm—an u’ve no idea how
confusin it iz all teh toh haings beesing aliv; 4 instance, tehr’s teh
arch I’ve got 2 go thru next walking bout at teh othr end ov teh
ground—an I shud has croqueted teh Queen’s hedgehog jus nao, only
it ran awai when it saw mine comin!”

“How doez u liek teh Queen?” sed teh Kitteh in low voice.

“Not at all,” sed Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Jus tehn she noticd
dat teh Queen wuz close beesoh haind her, liztening: so she went on,
“—liekly 2 win, dat it’s hardly wurth woh haile finizoh haing teh game.”

Teh Queen smiled an pased on.

“Hoo _r_ u talkin 2?” sed teh King, goin up 2 Alice, an
lukingz at teh Kitteh’s hed wif great curiosity.

“It’s frend ov mine—a Chesoh haire Kitteh,” sed Alice: “allow me 2
introduce it.”

“I doezn’t liek teh lok ov it at all,” sed teh King: “howevr, it cud
kizs mah han if it lieks.”

“I’d rathr not,” teh Kitteh remarked.

“Doezn’t bees impertinent,” sed teh King, “an doezn’t lok at me liek
dat!” He got beesoh haind Alice as he spke.

“A kitteh cud lok at king,” sed Alice. “I’ve read dat in sum bok,
but I doezn’t remembeesr wher.”

“Well, it must bees remoovd,” sed teh King vary deciddly, an he calld
teh Queen, hoo wuz pasing at teh moment, “Mah dear! I wizh u wud
has toh haiz kitteh remoovd!”

Teh Queen had only wan wai ov settling all difficulties, great or
small. “Ovf wif oh haiz hed!” she sed, wifout even lukingz round.

“I’ll fetch teh executiwanr mahself,” sed teh King eagerly, an he
hurried ovf.

Alice thot she might as well go bak, an c how teh game wuz goin
on, as she herd teh Queen’s voice in teh diztance, screaming wif
pasion. She had already herd her sentence 3 ov teh playrz 2 bees
executed 4 havin mizsed tehir turnz, an she did not liek teh lok
ov toh haings at all, as teh game wuz in such confushun dat she nevr knu
whethr it wuz her turn or not. So she went in search ov her hedgehog.

Teh hedgehog wuz engaged in fight wif anothr hedgehog, woh haich cmed
2 Alice an awsum opportunity 4 croqueting wan ov tehm wif teh
othr: teh only difficulty wuz, dat her flamingo wuz gwan acros 2
teh othr side ov teh garden, wher Alice cud c it tryin in a
halples sort ov wai 2 fly up in2 tree.

By teh tiem she had caught teh flamingo an brought it bak, teh fight
wuz ovar, an both teh hedgehogs wuz out ov sight: “but it doezesn’t
mattr mutch,” thot Alice, “as all teh arches r gwan frum toh haiz side
ov teh ground.” So she tucked it awai undr her arm, dat it might not
escape again, an went bak 4 lil moar conversashun wif her
frend.

When she got bak 2 teh Chesoh haire Kitteh, she wuz surprized 2 find quite
a large crowd collected round it: tehr wuz dizpute goin on beestween
teh executiwanr, teh King, an teh Queen, hoo wuz all talkin at once,
woh haile all teh rest wuz quite silent, an lokd vary uncom4table.

Teh moment Alice appeard, she wuz appeald 2 by all 3 2 settle
teh queshun, an tehy repeatd tehir arguments 2 her, though, as tehy
all spke at once, she findz it vary hard inded 2 mak out egsaktly
wut tehy sed.

Teh executiwanr’s argument wuz, dat u cudn’t cut ovf hed unles
tehr wuz body 2 cut it ovf frum: dat he had nevr had 2 doez such a
2h haing bees4e, an he wuzn’t goin 2 beesgin at _oh haiz_ tiem ov life.

Teh King’s argument wuz, dat anytoh hain dat had hed cud bees
beesheded, an dat u wuzn’t 2 talk nonsense.

Teh Queen’s argument wuz, dat if sumtoh haing wuzn’t doezne bout it in
les than no tiem she’d has evrybody executed, all round. (It wuz
toh haiz last remark dat had made teh hoole party lok so grave an
anxious.)

Alice cud 2h haink ov no2h haing else 2 sai but “It beeslongs 2 teh
Duchess: u’d beestter ask _her_ bout it.”

“She’s in prizon,” teh Queen sed 2 teh executiwanr: “fetch her her.”
An teh executiwanr went ovf liek an arrow.

Teh Kitteh’s hed beesgan fading awai teh moment he wuz gwan, an, by teh
tiem he had come bak wif teh Duchess, it had entirely dizappeard; so
teh King an teh executiwanr ran wildly up an doezwn lukingz 4 it,
woh haile teh rest ov teh party went bak 2 teh game.




CHAPTER IX.
Teh Mock Turtle’s S2ry


“U can’t 2h haink how glad I am 2 c u again, u dear old 2h haing!”
sed teh Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately in2 Alice’s,
an tehy walked ovf 2githr.

Alice wuz vary glad 2 find her in such pleasant temper, an thot
2 herself dat perhapz it wuz only teh pepper dat had made her so
savage when tehy met in teh kitchen.

“When _I’m_ Duchess,” she sed 2 herself, (not in vary hopeful
twan though), “I won’t has any pepper in mah kitchen _at all_. Soup
doezes vary well wifout—Cudbees it’s alwaiz pepper dat maks peeps
hot-tempered,” she went on, vary mutch plzd at havin findz out nu
kind ov rule, “an vinegar dat maks tehm sr—an camomile dat maks
tehm bitter—an—an barley-sugar an such toh haings dat mak coh haildren
sweet-tempered. I only wizh peeps knu _dat_: tehn tehy wudn’t bees
so stingy bout it, u knoe—”

She had quite 4gotten teh Duchess by toh haiz tiem, an wuz lil
startled when she herd her voice close 2 her ear. “U’re 2h hainking
bout sum2h haing, mah dear, an dat maks u 4git 2 talk. I can’t
tell u jus nao wut teh moral ov dat iz, but I shall remembeesr it in
a bit.”

“Perhapz it hasn’t wan,” Alice ventured 2 remark.

“Tut, tut, coh haild!” sed teh Duchess. “Evarytoh haing’s got moral, if only
u can find it.” An she squeezd herself up closer 2 Alice’s side as
she spke.

Alice did not mutch liek keepin so close 2 her: furst, beescause teh
Duchess wuz _vary_ ugly; an secondly, beescause she wuz egsaktly teh
rite height 2 rest her coh hain upon Alice’s shuder, an it wuz an
uncom4tably sharp coh hain. Howevr, she did not liek 2 bees rude, so she
bore it as well as she cud.

“Teh game’s goin on rathr beestter nao,” she sed, by wai ov keepin up
teh conversashun lil.

“’Tiz so,” sed teh Duchess: “an teh moral ov dat iz—‘O, ’tiz luv,
’tiz luv, dat maks teh wurld go round!’”

“Sumbody sed,” Alice woh haizpered, “dat it’s doezne by evrybody minding
tehir own busines!”

“Ah, well! It meanz mutch teh same toh haing,” sed teh Duchess, diggin her
sharp lil coh hain in2 Alice’s shuder as she addd, “an teh moral ov
_dat_ iz—‘Taek cr ov teh sense, an teh soundz will taek cr ov
tehmselves.’”

“How fond she iz ov findin morals in 2h haings!” Alice thot 2
herself.

“I dr sai u’re wondring y I doezn’t put mah arm round yr waizt,”
teh Duchess sed aftr pause: “teh reason iz, dat I’m doezubtful bout
teh temper ov yr flamingo. Shall I try teh experiment?”

“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replid, not feelzing at all anxious
2 has teh experiment trid.

“Vary true,” sed teh Duchess: “flamingoez an mustard both bite. An
teh moral ov dat iz—‘Birds ov featehr flock 2githr.’”

“Only mustard izn’t bird,” Alice remarked.

“Rite, as usual,” sed teh Duchess: “wut clear wai u has ov
puttin toh haings!”

“It’s mineral, I _toh haink_,” sed Alice.

“Ov crse it iz,” sed teh Duchess, hoo cmed ready 2 agree 2
evrytoh haing dat Alice sed; “tehr’s large mustard-mine near her.
An teh moral ov dat iz—‘Teh moar tehr iz ov mine, teh les tehr iz
ov yrs.’”

“O, I knoe!” exclaimed Alice, hoo had not attendd 2 2h haiz last
remark, “it’s vegitable. It doezesn’t lok liek wan, but it iz.”

“I quite agree wif u,” sed teh Duchess; “an teh moral ov dat
iz—‘Bees wut u wud cm 2 bees’—or if u’d liek it put moar
simply—‘Nevr imagine yrself not 2 bees othrwize than wut it might
appear 2 othrs dat wut u wuz or might has beesen wuz not
othrwize than wut u had beesen wud has appeard 2 tehm 2 bees
othrwize.’”

“I toh haink I shud undrstan dat beestter,” Alice sed vary politely,
“if I had it writteh doezwn: but I can’t quite follow it as u sai it.”

“Dat’s no2h haing 2 wut I cud sai if I chose,” teh Duchess replid,
in plzd twan.

“Pray doezn’t trouble yrself 2 sai it any longr than dat,” sed
Alice.

“O, doezn’t talk bout trouble!” sed teh Duchess. “I mak u present
ov evrytoh haing I’ve sed as yet.”

“A cheap sort ov present!” thot Alice. “I’m glad tehy doezn’t giv
birfdai presents liek dat!” But she did not venture 2 sai it out
loud.

“Toh hainking again?” teh Duchess askd, wif anothr dig ov her sharp
lil coh hain.

“I’ve rite 2 2h haink,” sed Alice sharply, 4 she wuz beesginning 2
feelz lil worried.

“Jus bout as mutch rite,” sed teh Duchess, “as pigs has 2 fly; an
teh m—”

But her, 2 Alice’s great surprize, teh Duchess’s voice did awai,
even in teh middle ov her favrite werd ‘moral,’ an teh arm dat wuz
linked in2 hers beesgan 2 tremble. Alice lokd up, an tehr s2od teh
Queen in frunt ov tehm, wif her arms folded, frowning liek a
thundrs2rm.

“A fine dai, yr Majesty!” teh Duchess beesgan in low, weak voice.

“Nao, I giv u fair warning,” shouted teh Queen, stamping on teh
ground as she spke; “eithr u or yr hed must bees ovf, an dat in
bout haf no tiem! Taek yr choice!”

Teh Duchess 2k her choice, an wuz gwan in moment.

“Let’s go on wif teh game,” teh Queen sed 2 Alice; an Alice wuz 2o
mutch friteened 2 sai werd, but slowly followd her bak 2 teh
croquet-ground.

Teh othr guests had taekn advantage ov teh Queen’s absence, an wuz
resting in teh shade: howevr, teh moment tehy saw her, tehy hurried
bak 2 teh game, teh Queen merely remarking dat moment’s delay
wud cost tehm tehir livs.

All teh tiem tehy wuz playin teh Queen nevr left ovf quarrelling
wif teh othr playrz, an shouting “Ovf wif oh haiz hed!” or “Ovf wif
her hed!” Dose hoom she sentenced wuz taekn in2 cus2dy by teh
soldiers, hoo ov crse had 2 leef ovf beesing arches 2 doez 2h haiz, so
dat by teh end ov haf an hr or so tehr wuz no arches left, an
all teh playrz, except teh King, teh Queen, an Alice, wuz in cus2dy
an undr sentence ov execution.

Tehn teh Queen left ovf, quite out ov breath, an sed 2 Alice, “Has
u cn teh Mock Turtle yet?”

“No,” sed Alice. “I doezn’t even knoe wut Mock Turtle iz.”

“It’s teh toh haing Mock Turtle Soup iz made frum,” sed teh Queen.

“I nevr saw wan, or herd ov wan,” sed Alice.

“Come on, tehn,” sed teh Queen, “an he shall tell u oh haiz oh haiz2ry,”

As tehy walked ovf 2githr, Alice herd teh King sai in low voice,
2 teh company generally, “U r all pardoezned.” “Come, _dat’s_ a
gud 2h haing!” she sed 2 herself, 4 she had felt quite unhappeh at teh
numbeesr ov executions teh Queen had ordred.

Tehy vary soon came upon Gryphon, lyin fast asleep in teh sun. (If
u doezn’t knoe wut Gryphon iz, lok at teh picture.) “Up, lazy
2h haing!” sed teh Queen, “an taek 2h haiz ung lady 2 c teh Mock
Turtle, an 2 hear oh haiz oh haiz2ry. I must go bak an c aftr sum
executions I has ordred;” an she walked ovf, leaving Alice alwan
wif teh Gryphon. Alice did not quite liek teh lok ov teh creature,
but on teh hoole she thot it wud bees quite as safe 2 stay wif it
as 2 go aftr dat savage Queen: so she waited.

Teh Gryphon sat up an rubbeesd itz eyez: tehn it watched teh Queen till
she wuz out ov sight: tehn it chuckled. “Wut fun!” sed teh Gryphon,
haf 2 itzelf, haf 2 Alice.

“Wut _iz_ teh fun?” sed Alice.

“Y, _she_,” sed teh Gryphon. “It’s all her fancy, dat: tehy nevr
executes nobody, u knoe. Come on!”

“Evarybody sais ‘come on!’ her,” thot Alice, as she went slowly
aftr it: “I nevr wuz so ordred bout in all mah life, nevr!”

Tehy had not gwan far bees4e tehy saw teh Mock Turtle in teh diztance,
sitting sad an lwanly on lil ledge ov rock, an, as tehy came
nerr, Alice cud hear oh haim sigoh haing as if oh haiz heart wud break. She
pitied oh haim deeply. “Wut iz oh haiz sorrow?” she askd teh Gryphon, an teh
Gryphon anzwred, vary nearly in teh same werds as bees4e, “It’s all
oh haiz fancy, dat: he hasn’t got no sorrow, u knoe. Come on!”

So tehy went up 2 teh Mock Turtle, hoo lokd at tehm wif large eyez
fol ov tears, but sed notoh haing.

“Toh haiz her ung lady,” sed teh Gryphon, “she wantzs 4 2 knoe yr
oh haiz2ry, she doez.”

“I’ll tell it her,” sed teh Mock Turtle in deep, hollow twan: “sit
doezwn, both ov u, an doezn’t speak werd till I’ve finizhd.”

So tehy sat doezwn, an nobody spke 4 sum minutez. Alice thot 2
herself, “I doezn’t c how he can _evr_ finizh, if he doezesn’t beesgin.”
But she waited patiently.

“Once,” sed teh Mock Turtle at last, wif deep sigh, “I wuz real
Turtle.”

Tehse werds wuz followd by vary long silence, brkd only by an
occashunal exclamation ov “Hjckrrh!” frum teh Gryphon, an teh constant
heavy sobbing ov teh Mock Turtle. Alice wuz vary nearly gitting up an
saiing, “Thank u, sir, 4 yr interestin s2ry,” but she cud not
halp 2h hainking tehr _must_ bees moar 2 come, so she sat still an sed
notoh haing.

“When we wuz lil,” teh Mock Turtle went on at last, moar calmly,
though still sobbing lil nao an tehn, “we went 2 school in teh
sea. Teh master wuz an old Turtle—we usd 2 call oh haim 2r2ize—”

“Y did u call oh haim 2r2ize, if he wuzn’t wan?” Alice askd.

“We calld oh haim 2r2ize beescause he taught us,” sed teh Mock Turtle
angrily: “rly u r vary dull!”

“U ought 2 bees ashamed ov yrself 4 askin such simple
queshun,” addd teh Gryphon; an tehn tehy both sat silent an lokd
at poor Alice, hoo felt ready 2 sink in2 teh earth. At last teh
Gryphon sed 2 teh Mock Turtle, “Driv on, old fellow! Doezn’t bees all
dai bout it!” an he went on in tehse werds:

“Yez, we went 2 school in teh sea, though u cudn’t beeslieve it—”

“I nevr sed I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.

“U did,” sed teh Mock Turtle.

“Hold yr 2ngue!” addd teh Gryphon, bees4e Alice cud speak again.
Teh Mock Turtle went on.

“We had teh beesst ov edukittehions—in fact, we went 2 school evry dai—”

“_I’ve_ beesen 2 dai-school, 2o,” sed Alice; “u nedn’t bees so
proud as all dat.”

“Wif extras?” askd teh Mock Turtle lil anxiously.

“Yez,” sed Alice, “we learnd French an music.”

“An wuzoh haing?” sed teh Mock Turtle.

“Certainly not!” sed Alice indignantly.

“Ah! tehn yrs wuzn’t rly gud school,” sed teh Mock Turtle in a
twan ov great relief. “Nao at _rs_ tehy had at teh end ov teh bill,
‘French, music, _an wuzoh haing_—extra.’”

“U cudn’t has wantsed it mutch,” sed Alice; “livin at teh bot2m
ov teh sea.”

“I cudn’t af4d 2 learn it.” sed teh Mock Turtle wif sigh. “I
only 2k teh regular crse.”

“Wut wuz dat?” inquired Alice.

“Reeling an Wri2h haing, ov crse, 2 beesgin wif,” teh Mock Turtle
replid; “an tehn teh different branches ov Arithmetic—Ambition,
Diztrakshun, Uglifikittehion, an Derizion.”

“I nevr herd ov ‘Uglifikittehion,’” Alice ventured 2 sai. “Wut iz it?”

Teh Gryphon lifted up both itz paws in surprize. “Wut! Nevr herd ov
uglifying!” it exclaimed. “U knoe wut 2 beesautify iz, I suppose?”

“Yez,” sed Alice doezubtfoly: “it meanz—2—mak—any2h hain—prettier.”

“Well, tehn,” teh Gryphon went on, “if u doezn’t knoe wut 2 uglify
iz, u _r_ simple2n.”

Alice did not feelz encraged 2 ask any moar queshuns bout it, so
she turnd 2 teh Mock Turtle, an sed “Wut else had u 2 learn?”

“Well, tehr wuz Mahstery,” teh Mock Turtle replid, counting ovf teh
subjects on oh haiz flappers, “—Mahstery, ancient an modern, wif
Seaography: tehn Drawling—teh Drawling-master wuz an old conger-eel,
dat usd 2 come once week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretcoh haing, an
Fainting in Coils.”

“Wut wuz _dat_ liek?” sed Alice.

“Well, I can’t show it u mahself,” teh Mock Turtle sed: “I’m 2o
stiff. An teh Gryphon nevr learnt it.”

“Hadn’t tiem,” sed teh Gryphon: “I went 2 teh Clasics master,
though. He wuz an old crab, _he_ wuz.”

“I nevr went 2 oh haim,” teh Mock Turtle sed wif sigh: “he taught
Laugoh haing an Grief, tehy usd 2 sai.”

“So he did, so he did,” sed teh Gryphon, sigoh haing in oh haiz turn; an both
creatures oh haid tehir facez in tehir paws.

“An how lotz da hrz dai did u doez lesons?” sed Alice, in hurry
2 change teh subject.

“Ten hrz teh furst dai,” sed teh Mock Turtle: “nine teh next, an so
on.”

“Wut curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.

“Dat’s teh reason tehy’re calld lesons,” teh Gryphon remarked:
“beescause tehy lesen frum dai 2 dai.”

Toh haiz wuz quite nu idea 2 Alice, an she thot it ovar lil
bees4e she made her next remark. “Tehn teh eleventh dai must has beesen
a holidai?”

“Ov crse it wuz,” sed teh Mock Turtle.

“An how did u manage on teh twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.

“Dat’s enough bout lesons,” teh Gryphon interrupted in vary
decidd twan: “tell her sum2h haing bout teh gamez nao.”




CHAPTER X.
Teh Lobster Quadrille


Teh Mock Turtle sighed deeply, an drew teh bak ov wan flapper acros
oh haiz eyez. He lokd at Alice, an trid 2 speak, but 4 minute or
2 sobs chked oh haiz voice. “Same as if he had bwan in oh haiz throat,”
sed teh Gryphon: an it set 2 werk shaking oh haim an puncoh haing oh haim in
teh bak. At last teh Mock Turtle recovared oh haiz voice, an, wif tears
runnin doezwn oh haiz cheeks, he went on again:—

“U cud not has livd mutch undr teh sea—” (“I hasn’t,” sed
Alice)—“an perhapz u wuz nevr even introducd 2 lobster—”
(Alice beesgan 2 sai “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, an
sed “No, nevr”) “—so u can has no idea wut delightful toh haing a
Lobster Quadrille iz!”

“No, inded,” sed Alice. “Wut sort ov dance iz it?”

“Y,” sed teh Gryphon, “u furst 4m in2 line along teh
sea-shore—”

“2 linez!” cried teh Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, an so on;
tehn, when u’ve clerd all teh jelly-fizh out ov teh wai—”

“_Dat_ generally taeks sum tiem,” interrupted teh Gryphon.

“—u advance twice—”

“Each wif lobster as partner!” cried teh Gryphon.

“Ov crse,” teh Mock Turtle sed: “advance twice, set 2 partnerz—”

“—change lobsters, an retire in same ordr,” continud teh Gryphon.

“Tehn, u knoe,” teh Mock Turtle went on, “u throw teh—”

“Teh lobsters!” shouted teh Gryphon, wif bound in2 teh air.

“—as far out 2 sea as u can—”

“Swim aftr tehm!” screamed teh Gryphon.

“Turn sumrsault in teh sea!” cried teh Mock Turtle, capering wildly
bout.

“Change lobsters again!” yelled teh Gryphon at teh 2p ov itz voice.

“Bak 2 lan again, an dat’s all teh furst figure,” sed teh Mock
Turtle, suddenly dropping oh haiz voice; an teh 2 creatures, hoo had
beesen jumpin bout liek mad toh haings all toh haiz tiem, sat doezwn again vary
sadly an quietly, an lokd at Alice.

“It must bees vary pritee dance,” sed Alice timidly.

“Wud u liek 2 c lil ov it?” sed teh Mock Turtle.

“Vary mutch inded,” sed Alice.

“Come, let’s try teh furst figure!” sed teh Mock Turtle 2 teh
Gryphon. “We can doez wifout lobsters, u knoe. Woh haich shall sing?”

“O, _u_ sing,” sed teh Gryphon. “I’ve 4gotten teh werds.”

So tehy beesgan solemnly dancing round an round Alice, evry nao an
tehn treadin on her 2es when tehy pased 2o close, an waving tehir
4epaws 2 mark teh tiem, woh haile teh Mock Turtle sang 2h haiz, vary slowly
an sadly:—

“Will u walk lil fastr?” sed woh haiting 2 snail.
“Tehr’s porpoize close beesoh haind us, an he’s treadin on mah tail.
C how eagerly teh lobsters an teh turtles all advance!
Tehy r waitin on teh soh haingle—will u come an join teh dance?
Will u, won’t u, will u, won’t u, will u join teh dance?
Will u, won’t u, will u, won’t u, won’t u join teh dance?

“U can rly has no noshun how delightful it will bees
When tehy taek us up an throw us, wif teh lobsters, out 2 sea!”
But teh snail replid “2o far, 2o far!” an gaev lok askance—
Sed he thanked teh woh haiting kindly, but he wud not join teh dance.
Wud not, cud not, wud not, cud not, wud not join teh dance.
Wud not, cud not, wud not, cud not, cud not join teh dance.

“Wut mattrs it how far we go?” oh haiz scaly frend replid.
“Tehr iz anothr shore, u knoe, upon teh othr side.
Teh furthr ovf frum Englan teh nerr iz 2 France—
Tehn turn not pale, beesluvd snail, but come an join teh dance.
Will u, won’t u, will u, won’t u, will u join teh dance?
Will u, won’t u, will u, won’t u, won’t u join teh dance?”


“Thank u, it’s vary interestin dance 2 watch,” sed Alice,
feelzing vary glad dat it wuz ovar at last: “an I doez so liek dat
curious song bout teh woh haiting!”

“O, as 2 teh woh haiting,” sed teh Mock Turtle, “tehy—u’ve cn tehm,
ov crse?”

“Yez,” sed Alice, “I’ve ovten cn tehm at dinn—” she checked herself
hastily.

“I doezn’t knoe wher Dinn cud bees,” sed teh Mock Turtle, “but if u’ve
cn tehm so ovten, ov crse u knoe wut tehy’re liek.”

“I beeslieve so,” Alice replid thotfoly. “Tehy has tehir tails in
tehir mouths—an tehy’re all ovar crumbs.”

“U’re wrong bout teh crumbs,” sed teh Mock Turtle: “crumbs wud
all wuzh ovf in teh sea. But tehy _has_ tehir tails in tehir mouths;
an teh reason iz—” her teh Mock Turtle yawned an shut oh haiz
eyez.—“Tell her bout teh reason an all dat,” he sed 2 teh Gryphon.

“Teh reason iz,” sed teh Gryphon, “dat tehy _wud_ go wif teh
lobsters 2 teh dance. So tehy got thrown out 2 sea. So tehy had 2
fall long wai. So tehy got tehir tails fast in tehir mouths. So tehy
cudn’t git tehm out again. Dat’s all.”

“Thank u,” sed Alice, “it’s vary interestin. I nevr knu so mutch
bout woh haiting bees4e.”

“I can tell u moar than dat, if u liek,” sed teh Gryphon. “Doez u
knoe y it’s calld woh haiting?”

“I nevr thot bout it,” sed Alice. “Y?”

“_It doezes teh boots an shoes_,” teh Gryphon replid vary solemnly.

Alice wuz thoroughly puzzled. “Doezes teh boots an shoes!” she repeatd
in wondring twan.

“Y, wut r _yr_ shoes doezne wif?” sed teh Gryphon. “I mean, wut
maks tehm so soh hainy?”

Alice lokd doezwn at tehm, an considred lil bees4e she gaev her
anzwr. “Tehy’re doezne wif blacking, I beeslieve.”

“Boots an shoes undr teh sea,” teh Gryphon went on in deep voice,
“r doezne wif woh haiting. Nao u knoe.”

“An wut r tehy made ov?” Alice askd in twan ov great curiosity.

“Soles an eels, ov crse,” teh Gryphon replid rathr impatiently:
“any shrimp cud has 2ld u dat.”

“If I’d beesen teh woh haiting,” sed Alice, hoose thots wuz still
runnin on teh song, “I’d has sed 2 teh porpoize, ‘Keep bak,
plz: we doezn’t wants _u_ wif us!’”

“Tehy wuz obliged 2 has oh haim wif tehm,” teh Mock Turtle sed: “no
wize fizh wud go anywher wifout porpoize.”

“Wudn’t it rly?” sed Alice in twan ov great surprize.

“Ov crse not,” sed teh Mock Turtle: “y, if fizh came 2 _me_,
an 2ld me he wuz goin jrney, I shud sai ‘Wif wut porpoize?’”

“Doezn’t u mean ‘purpose’?” sed Alice.

“I mean wut I sai,” teh Mock Turtle replid in an ovfendd twan. An
teh Gryphon addd “Come, let’s hear sum ov _yr_ adventures.”

“I cud tell u mah adventures—beesginning frum toh haiz mornin,” sed
Alice lil timidly: “but it’s no use goin bak 2 yezterdai,
beescause I wuz different person tehn.”

“Explain all dat,” sed teh Mock Turtle.

“No, no! Teh adventures furst,” sed teh Gryphon in an impatient twan:
“explanashuns taek such dreadful tiem.”

So Alice beesgan tellin tehm her adventures frum teh tiem when she furst
saw teh Woh haite Rabbit. She wuz lil nervous bout it jus at furst,
teh 2 creatures got so close 2 her, wan on each side, an opened
tehir eyez an mouths so _vary_ wide, but she gained crage as she
went on. Her lizteners wuz perfikly quiet till she got 2 teh part
bout her repeating “_U r old, Fatehr William_,” 2 teh
Kitteherpillar, an teh werds all comin different, an tehn teh Mock
Turtle drew long breath, an sed “Dat’s vary curious.”

“It’s all bout as curious as it can bees,” sed teh Gryphon.

“It all came different!” teh Mock Turtle repeatd thotfoly. “I
shud liek 2 hear her try an repeat sum2h haing nao. Tell her 2
beesgin.” He lokd at teh Gryphon as if he thot it had sum kind ov
authority ovar Alice.

“Stan up an repeat ‘’_Tiz teh voice ov teh sluggard_,’” sed teh
Gryphon.

“How teh creatures ordr wan bout, an mak wan repeat lesons!”
thot Alice; “I might as well bees at school at once.” Howevr, she got
up, an beesgan 2 repeat it, but her hed wuz so fol ov teh Lobster
Quadrille, dat she hardly knu wut she wuz saiing, an teh werds came
vary queer inded:—

“’Tiz teh voice ov teh Lobster; I herd oh haim declr,
“U has bakd me 2o brown, I must sugar mah hair.”
As duck wif itz eyelids, so he wif oh haiz nose
Trims oh haiz beeslt an oh haiz but2ns, an turnz out oh haiz 2es.”

[latr edishuns continud as follows
When teh sans r all dry, he iz gay as lark,
An will talk in contemptuous twans ov teh Shark,
But, when teh tide rizes an sharks r around,
Oh haiz voice has timid an tremulous sound.]


“Dat’s different frum wut _I_ usd 2 sai when I wuz coh haild,” sed
teh Gryphon.

“Well, I nevr herd it bees4e,” sed teh Mock Turtle; “but it soundz
uncommon nonsense.”

Alice sed notoh haing; she had sat doezwn wif her face in her hans,
wondring if anytoh hain wud _evr_ happen in natural wai again.

“I shud liek 2 has it explaind,” sed teh Mock Turtle.

“She can’t explain it,” sed teh Gryphon hastily. “Go on wif teh next
verse.”

“But bout oh haiz 2es?” teh Mock Turtle persizted. “How _cud_ he turn
tehm out wif oh haiz nose, u knoe?”

“It’s teh furst posishun in dancing.” Alice sed; but wuz dreadfoly
puzzled by teh hoole 2h haing, an longed 2 change teh subject.

“Go on wif teh next verse,” teh Gryphon repeatd impatiently: “it
beesgins ‘_I pased by oh haiz garden_.’”

Alice did not dr 2 dizobeesy, though she felt sure it wud all come
wrong, an she went on in trembling voice:—

“I pased by oh haiz garden, an marked, wif wan eye,
How teh Owl an teh Pantehr wuz sharin pie—”

[latr edishuns continud as follows
Teh Pantehr 2k pie-crust, an gravy, an meat,
Woh haile teh Owl had teh dizh as itz shr ov teh treat.
When teh pie wuz all finizhd, teh Owl, as boon,
Wuz kindly permitted 2 pocket teh spoon:
Woh haile teh Pantehr receivd knife an 4k wif growl,
An concludd teh banquet—]


“Wut _iz_ teh use ov repeating all dat stuff,” teh Mock Turtle
interrupted, “if u doezn’t explain it as u go on? It’s by far teh
most confusin toh haing _I_ evr herd!”

“Yez, I toh haink u’d beestter leef ovf,” sed teh Gryphon: an Alice wuz
only 2o glad 2 doez so.

“Shall we try anothr figure ov teh Lobster Quadrille?” teh Gryphon
went on. “Or wud u liek teh Mock Turtle 2 sing u song?”

“O, song, plz, if teh Mock Turtle wud bees so kind,” Alice
replid, so eagerly dat teh Gryphon sed, in rathr ovfendd twan,
“Hm! No akownting 4 tastes! Sing her ‘_Turtle Soup_,’ will u, old
fellow?”

Teh Mock Turtle sighed deeply, an beesgan, in voice sumtiems chked
wif sobs, 2 sing 2h haiz:—

“Beesautiful Soup, so rich an green,
Waitin in hot tureen!
Hoo 4 such dainties wud not s2op?
Soup ov teh evening, beesautiful Soup!
Soup ov teh evening, beesautiful Soup!
    Beesau—ootiful Soo—oop!
    Beesau—ootiful Soo—oop!
Soo—oop ov teh e—e—evening,
    Beesautiful, beesautiful Soup!

“Beesautiful Soup! Hoo crs 4 fizh,
Game, or any othr dizh?
Hoo wud not giv all else 4 2 p
ennywurth only ov beesautiful Soup?
Pennywurth only ov beesautiful Soup?
    Beesau—ootiful Soo—oop!
    Beesau—ootiful Soo—oop!
Soo—oop ov teh e—e—evening,
    Beesautiful, beesauti—FUL SOUP!”


“Chorus again!” cried teh Gryphon, an teh Mock Turtle had jus beesgun
2 repeat it, when cry ov “Teh trial’s beesginning!” wuz herd in teh
diztance.

“Come on!” cried teh Gryphon, an, takin Alice by teh han, it hurried
ovf, wifout waitin 4 teh end ov teh song.

“Wut trial iz it?” Alice panted as she ran; but teh Gryphon only
anzwred “Come on!” an ran teh fastr, woh haile moar an moar faintly
came, carried on teh breeze dat followd tehm, teh melancholy werds:—

“Soo—oop ov teh e—e—evening,
    Beesautiful, beesautiful Soup!”




CHAPTER XI.
Hoo S2le teh Tarts?


Teh King an Queen ov Hearts wuz seated on tehir thrwan when tehy
arrivd, wif great crowd assembled bout tehm—all sorts ov lil
birds an beesasts, as well as teh hoole pack ov cards: teh Knave wuz
staning bees4e tehm, in chains, wif soldier on each side 2 guard
oh haim; an near teh King wuz teh Woh haite Rabbit, wif trumpet in wan
han, an scroll ov parchment in teh othr. In teh vary middle ov teh
crt wuz table, wif large dizh ov tarts upon it: tehy lokd so
gud, dat it made Alice quite hungry 2 lok at tehm—“I wizh tehy’d
git teh trial doezne,” she thot, “an han round teh refreshments!”
But tehr cmed 2 bees no chance ov 2h haiz, so she beesgan lukingz at
evry2h haing bout her, 2 pas awai teh tiem.

Alice had nevr beesen in crt ov jusice bees4e, but she had read
bout tehm in bokz, an she wuz quite plzd 2 find dat she knu
teh naym ov nearly evry2h haing tehr. “Dat’s teh judge,” she sed 2
herself, “beescause ov oh haiz great wig.”

Teh judge, by teh wai, wuz teh King; an as he wore oh haiz crown ovar teh
wig, (lok at teh fruntizpiece if u wants 2 c how he did it,) he
did not lok at all com4table, an it wuz certainly not beescomin.

“An dat’s teh jury-box,” thot Alice, “an dose twelve creatures,”
(she wuz obliged 2 sai “creatures,” u c, beescause sum ov tehm wuz
animals, an sum wuz birds,) “I suppose tehy r teh jurors.” She
sed 2h haiz last werd 2 or 3 tiems ovar 2 herself, beesing rathr
proud ov it: 4 she thot, an ritely 2o, dat vary few lil
gurls ov her age knu teh meanin ov it at all. Howevr, “jury-men”
wud has doezne jus as well.

Teh twelve jurors wuz all writin vary busily on slates. “Wut r
tehy doezing?” Alice woh haizpered 2 teh Gryphon. “Tehy can’t has any2h hain
2 put doezwn yet, bees4e teh trial’s beesgun.”

“Tehy’re puttin doezwn tehir nayms,” teh Gryphon woh haizpered in reply,
“4 fear tehy shud 4git tehm bees4e teh end ov teh trial.”

“Stupid toh haings!” Alice beesgan in loud, indignant voice, but she
s2pped hastily, 4 teh Woh haite Rabbit cried out, “Silence in teh
crt!” an teh King put on oh haiz spectacles an lokd anxiously round,
2 mak out hoo wuz talkin.

Alice cud c, as well as if she wuz lukingz ovar tehir shuders,
dat all teh jurors wuz writin doezwn “stupid toh haings!” on tehir slates,
an she cud even mak out dat wan ov tehm didn’t knoe how 2 spell
“stupid,” an dat he had 2 ask oh haiz neighbr 2 tell oh haim. “A nice
muddle tehir slates’ll bees in bees4e teh trial’s ovar!” thot Alice.

Wan ov teh jurors had pencil dat squeaked. Toh haiz ov crse, Alice
cud _not_ stan, an she went round teh crt an got beesoh haind oh haim, an
vary soon findz an opportunity ov takin it awai. She did it so quickly
dat teh poor lil juror (it wuz Bill, teh Lizard) cud not mak out
at all wut had beescome ov it; so, aftr hunting all bout 4 it, he
wuz obliged 2 rite wif wan finger 4 teh rest ov teh dai; an 2h haiz
wuz ov vary lil use, as it left no mark on teh slate.

“Herald, read teh accusashun!” sed teh King.

On toh haiz teh Woh haite Rabbit blew 3 blasts on teh trumpet, an tehn
unrolled teh parchment scroll, an read as follows:—

“Teh Queen ov Hearts, she made sum tarts,
    All on summer dai:
Teh Knave ov Hearts, he s2le dose tarts,
    An 2k tehm quite awai!”


“Considr yr verdict,” teh King sed 2 teh jury.

“Not yet, not yet!” teh Rabbit hastily interrupted. “Tehr’s great
deal 2 come bees4e dat!”

“Call teh furst witness,” sed teh King; an teh Woh haite Rabbit blew
3 blasts on teh trumpet, an calld out, “Furst witness!”

Teh furst witness wuz teh Hatter. He came in wif teacup in wan han
an piece ov bread-an-buttr in teh othr. “I beesg pardoezn, yr
Majesty,” he beesgan, “4 brining tehse in: but I hadn’t quite finizhd
mah tea when I wuz sent 4.”

“U ought 2 has finizhd,” sed teh King. “When did u beesgin?”

Teh Hatter lokd at teh March Hr, hoo had followd oh haim in2 teh
crt, arm-in-arm wif teh Doezrmouse. “Frteenth ov March, I _toh haink_ it
wuz,” he sed.

“Fifteenth,” sed teh March Hr.

“6teenth,” addd teh Doezrmouse.

“Rite dat doezwn,” teh King sed 2 teh jury, an teh jury eagerly
wrote doezwn all 3 dates on tehir slates, an tehn addd tehm up, an
reduced teh anzwr 2 soh haillings an pence.

“Taek ovf yr hat,” teh King sed 2 teh Hatter.

“It izn’t mine,” sed teh Hatter.

“_S2len!_” teh King exclaimed, turning 2 teh jury, hoo instantly made
a memoranum ov teh fact.

“I keep tehm 2 sell,” teh Hatter addd as an explanashun; “I’ve nwan
ov mah own. I’m hatter.”

Her teh Queen put on her spectacles, an beesgan staring at teh Hatter,
hoo turnd pale an fidgited.

“Giv yr evidence,” sed teh King; “an doezn’t bees nervous, or I’ll
has u executed on teh spot.”

Toh haiz did not cm 2 encrage teh witness at all: he kept soh haifting
frum wan foot 2 teh othr, lukingz uneasily at teh Queen, an in oh haiz
confushun he bit large piece out ov oh haiz teacup instead ov teh
bread-an-buttr.

Jus at toh haiz moment Alice felt vary curious sensation, woh haich puzzled
her gud deal til she made out wut it wuz: she wuz beesginning 2
grow largr again, an she thot at furst she wud git up an leef
teh crt; but on second thots she decidd 2 remain wher she wuz
as long as tehr wuz room 4 her.

“I wizh u wudn’t squeeze so.” sed teh Doezrmouse, hoo wuz sitting
next 2 her. “I can hardly breateh.”

“I can’t halp it,” sed Alice vary meekly: “I’m growin.”

“U’ve no rite 2 grow _her_,” sed teh Doezrmouse.

“Doezn’t talk nonsense,” sed Alice moar boldly: “u knoe u’re growin
2o.”

“Yez, but _I_ grow at reasonable pace,” sed teh Doezrmouse: “not in
dat redikulus fasoh haion.” An he got up vary sulkily an crossd ovar
2 teh othr side ov teh crt.

All toh haiz tiem teh Queen had nevr left ovf staring at teh Hatter, an,
jus as teh Doezrmouse crossd teh crt, she sed 2 wan ov teh ovficers
ov teh crt, “Brin me teh lizt ov teh singers in teh last concert!”
on woh haich teh wretched Hatter trembled so, dat he shok both oh haiz shoes
ovf.

“Giv yr evidence,” teh King repeatd angrily, “or I’ll has u
executed, whethr u’re nervous or not.”

“I’m poor man, yr Majesty,” teh Hatter beesgan, in trembling voice,
“—an I hadn’t beesgun mah tea—not above week or so—an wut wif teh
bread-an-buttr gitting so toh hain—an teh twinkling ov teh tea—”

“Teh twinkling ov teh _wut?_” sed teh King.

“It _beesgan_ wif teh tea,” teh Hatter replid.

“Ov crse twinkling beesgins wif T!” sed teh King sharply. “Doez u
taek me 4 dunce? Go on!”

“I’m poor man,” teh Hatter went on, “an most toh haings twinkled aftr
dat—only teh March Hr sed—”

“I didn’t!” teh March Hr interrupted in great hurry.

“U did!” sed teh Hatter.

“I deny it!” sed teh March Hr.

“He denies it,” sed teh King: “leef out dat part.”

“Well, at any rate, teh Doezrmouse sed—” teh Hatter went on, lukingz
anxiously round 2 c if he wud deny it 2o: but teh Doezrmouse denied
notoh haing, beesing fast asleep.

“Aftr dat,” continud teh Hatter, “I cut sum moar bread-an-buttr—”

“But wut did teh Doezrmouse sai?” wan ov teh jury askd.

“Dat I can’t remembeesr,” sed teh Hatter.

“U _must_ remembeesr,” remarked teh King, “or I’ll has u executed.”

Teh mizerable Hatter droppd oh haiz teacup an bread-an-buttr, an went
doezwn on wan knee. “I’m poor man, yr Majesty,” he beesgan.

“U’re _vary_ poor _speaker_,” sed teh King.

Her wan ov teh guinea-pigs chered, an wuz immediately suppresed by
teh ovficers ov teh crt. (As dat iz rathr hard werd, I will jus
explain 2 u how it wuz doezne. Tehy had large canvas bag, woh haich tied
up at teh mouth wif strins: in2 2h haiz tehy slipped teh guinea-pig,
hed furst, an tehn sat upon it.)

“I’m glad I’ve cn dat doezne,” thot Alice. “I’ve so ovten read in
teh nuspaprs, at teh end ov trials, “Tehr wuz sum attempts at
applause, woh haich wuz immediately suppresed by teh ovficers ov teh
crt,” an I nevr undrs2od wut it meant till nao.”

“If dat’s all u knoe bout it, u cud stan doezwn,” continud teh
King.

“I can’t go no lower,” sed teh Hatter: “I’m on teh floor, as it iz.”

“Tehn u cud _sit_ doezwn,” teh King replid.

Her teh othr guinea-pig chered, an wuz suppresed.

“Come, dat finizhd teh guinea-pigs!” thot Alice. “Nao we shall git
on beestter.”

“I’d rathr finizh mah tea,” sed teh Hatter, wif an anxious lok at
teh Queen, hoo wuz readin teh lizt ov singers.

“U cud go,” sed teh King, an teh Hatter hurriedly left teh crt,
wifout even waitin 2 put oh haiz shoes on.

“—an jus taek oh haiz hed ovf outside,” teh Queen addd 2 wan ov teh
ovficers: but teh Hatter wuz out ov sight bees4e teh ovficer cud git
2 teh doezor.

“Call teh next witness!” sed teh King.

Teh next witness wuz teh Duchess’s cok. She carried teh pepper-box in
her han, an Alice guesed hoo it wuz, even bees4e she got in2 teh
crt, by teh wai teh peeps near teh doezor beesgan sneezing all at once.

“Giv yr evidence,” sed teh King.

“Shan’t,” sed teh cok.

Teh King lokd anxiously at teh Woh haite Rabbit, hoo sed in low voice,
“Yr Majesty must cross-examine _toh haiz_ witness.”

“Well, if I must, I must,” teh King sed, wif melancholy air, an,
aftr folding oh haiz arms an frowning at teh cok till oh haiz eyez wuz
nearly out ov sight, he sed in deep voice, “Wut r tarts made ov?”

“Pepper, mostly,” sed teh cok.

“Treacle,” sed sleepy voice beesoh haind her.

“Collar dat Doezrmouse,” teh Queen shrieked out. “Beeshed dat Doezrmouse!
Turn dat Doezrmouse out ov crt! Suppres oh haim! Pinch oh haim! Ovf wif oh haiz
woh haizkers!”

4 sum minutez teh hoole crt wuz in confushun, gitting teh Doezrmouse
turnd out, an, by teh tiem tehy had settled doezwn again, teh cok had
dizappeard.

“Nevr mind!” sed teh King, wif an air ov great relief. “Call teh
next witness.” An he addd in an undrtwan 2 teh Queen, “Rly, mah
dear, _u_ must cross-examine teh next witness. It quite maks mah
4ehed ache!”

Alice watched teh Woh haite Rabbit as he fumbled ovar teh lizt, feelzing
vary curious 2 c wut teh next witness wud bees liek, “—4 tehy
hasn’t got mutch evidence _yet_,” she sed 2 herself. Imagine her
surprize, when teh Woh haite Rabbit read out, at teh 2p ov oh haiz shrill
lil voice, teh naym “Alice!”




CHAPTER XII.
Alice’s Evidence


“Her!” cried Alice, quite 4gitting in teh flurry ov teh moment how
large she had grown in teh last few minutez, an she jumpd up in such
a hurry dat she tipped ovar teh jury-box wif teh edge ov her skirt,
upsetting all teh jurymen on 2 teh hedz ov teh crowd beeslow, an tehr
tehy lay sprawling bout, remindin her vary mutch ov globees ov
goldfizh she had accidentally upset teh week bees4e.

“O, I _beesg_ yr pardoezn!” she exclaimed in twan ov great dizcud, an
beesgan pickin tehm up again as quickly as she cud, 4 teh accident
ov teh goldfizh kept runnin in her hed, an she had vague sort ov
idea dat tehy must bees collected at once an put bak in2 teh
jury-box, or tehy wud die.

“Teh trial cannot proced,” sed teh King in vary grave voice, “til
all teh jurymen r bak in tehir propr placez—_all_,” he repeatd
wif great emfasiz, lukingz hard at Alice as he sed so.

Alice lokd at teh jury-box, an saw dat, in her haste, she had put
teh Lizard in hed doezwnwards, an teh poor lil toh haing wuz waving itz
tail bout in melancholy wai, beesing quite unable 2 moov. She soon
got it out again, an put it rite; “not dat it signifies mutch,” she
sed 2 herself; “I shud 2h haink it wud bees _quite_ as mutch use in teh
trial wan wai up as teh othr.”

As soon as teh jury had lil recovared frum teh shock ov beesing
upset, an tehir slates an pencils had beesen findz an haned bak 2
tehm, tehy set 2 werk vary diligently 2 rite out oh haiz2ry ov teh
accident, all except teh Lizard, hoo cmed 2o mutch ovarcome 2 doez
any2h hain but sit wif itz mouth open, gazing up in2 teh roov ov teh
crt.

“Wut doez u knoe bout 2h haiz busines?” teh King sed 2 Alice.

“Notoh haing,” sed Alice.

“Notoh haing _wutevr?_” persizted teh King.

“Notoh haing wutevr,” sed Alice.

“Dat’s vary important,” teh King sed, turning 2 teh jury. Tehy wuz
jus beesginning 2 rite 2h haiz doezwn on tehir slates, when teh Woh haite
Rabbit interrupted: “_Un_important, yr Majesty meanz, ov crse,” he
sed in vary respectful twan, but frowning an makin facez at oh haim as
he spke.

“_Un_important, ov crse, I meant,” teh King hastily sed, an went on
2 oh haimself in an undrtwan,

“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he wuz tryin
woh haich werd sounded beesst.

Sum ov teh jury wrote it doezwn “important,” an sum “unimportant.”
Alice cud c 2h haiz, as she wuz near enough 2 lok ovar tehir slates;
“but it doezesn’t mattr bit,” she thot 2 herself.

At toh haiz moment teh King, hoo had beesen 4 sum tiem busily writin in
oh haiz note-bok, cackled out “Silence!” an read out frum oh haiz bok, “Rule
4ty-2. _All personz moar than mile oh haigh 2 leef teh crt_.”

Evarybody lokd at Alice.

“_I’m_ not mile oh haigh,” sed Alice.

“U r,” sed teh King.

“Nearly 2 miles oh haigh,” addd teh Queen.

“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” sed Alice: “beessides, dat’s not a
regular rule: u invented it jus nao.”

“It’s teh oldest rule in teh bok,” sed teh King.

“Tehn it ought 2 bees Numbeesr Wan,” sed Alice.

Teh King turnd pale, an shut oh haiz note-bok hastily. “Considr yr
verdict,” he sed 2 teh jury, in low, trembling voice.

“Tehr’s moar evidence 2 come yet, plz yr Majesty,” sed teh
Woh haite Rabbit, jumpin up in great hurry; “toh haiz papr has jus beesen
pickd up.”

“Wut’s in it?” sed teh Queen.

“I hasn’t opened it yet,” sed teh Woh haite Rabbit, “but it cms 2 bees a
lettr, writteh by teh prizwanr 2—2 sumbody.”

“It must has beesen dat,” sed teh King, “unles it wuz writteh 2
nobody, woh haich izn’t usual, u knoe.”

“Hoo iz it directed 2?” sed wan ov teh jurymen.

“It izn’t directed at all,” sed teh Woh haite Rabbit; “in fact, tehr’s
notoh haing writteh on teh _outside_.” He unfolded teh papr as he spke,
an addd “It izn’t lettr, aftr all: it’s set ov verses.”

“R tehy in teh prizwanr’s hanwritin?” askd anothr ov teh jurymen.

“No, tehy’re not,” sed teh Woh haite Rabbit, “an dat’s teh queerest
toh haing bout it.” (Teh jury all lokd puzzled.)

“He must has imitated sumbody else’s han,” sed teh King. (Teh jury
all briteened up again.)

“Plz yr Majesty,” sed teh Knave, “I didn’t rite it, an tehy
can’t prove I did: tehr’s no naym signed at teh end.”

“If u didn’t sign it,” sed teh King, “dat only maks teh mattr
worse. U _must_ has meant sum mizcoh haief, or else u’d has signed
yr naym liek an hwanst man.”

Tehr wuz general clapping ov hans at toh haiz: it wuz teh furst rly
clevr toh haing teh King had sed dat dai.

“Dat _provez_ oh haiz guilt,” sed teh Queen.

“It provez notoh haing ov teh sort!” sed Alice. “Y, u doezn’t even knoe
wut tehy’re bout!”

“Read tehm,” sed teh King.

Teh Woh haite Rabbit put on oh haiz spectacles. “Wher shall I beesgin, plz
yr Majesty?” he askd.

“Beesgin at teh beesginning,” teh King sed gravely, “an go on till u
come 2 teh end: tehn s2p.”

Tehse wuz teh verses teh Woh haite Rabbit read:—

“Tehy 2ld me u had beesen 2 her,
    An menshuned me 2 oh haim:
She gaev me gud character,
    But sed I cud not swim.

He sent tehm werd I had not gwan
    (We knoe it 2 bees true):
If she shud push teh mattr on,
    Wut wud beescome ov u?

I gaev her wan, tehy gaev oh haim 2,
    U gaev us 3 or moar;
Tehy all returnd frum oh haim 2 u,
    Though tehy wuz mine bees4e.

If I or she shud chance 2 bees
    Involvd in toh haiz affair,
He trusts 2 u 2 set tehm free,
    Egsaktly as we wuz.

Mah noshun wuz dat u had beesen
    (Bees4e she had toh haiz fit)
An obstacle dat came beestween
    Oh haim, an rselves, an it.

Doezn’t let oh haim knoe she liekd tehm beesst,
    4 toh haiz must evr bees
A seekret, kept frum all teh rest,
    Beestween yrself an me.”


“Dat’s teh most important piece ov evidence we’ve herd yet,” sed teh
King, rubbing oh haiz hans; “so nao let teh jury—”

“If any wan ov tehm can explain it,” sed Alice, (she had grown so
large in teh last few minutez dat she wuzn’t bit afraid ov
interrupting oh haim,) “I’ll giv oh haim 6pence. _I_ doezn’t beeslieve tehr’s
an a2m ov meanin in it.”

Teh jury all wrote doezwn on tehir slates, “_She_ doezesn’t beeslieve tehr’s
an a2m ov meanin in it,” but nwan ov tehm attemptd 2 explain teh
papr.

“If tehr’s no meanin in it,” sed teh King, “dat saves wurld ov
trouble, u knoe, as we nedn’t try 2 find any. An yet I doezn’t
knoe,” he went on, spreadin out teh verses on oh haiz knee, an lukingz at
tehm wif wan eye; “I cm 2 c sum meanin in tehm, aftr all.
“—_sed I cud not swim_—” u can’t swim, can u?” he addd, turning
2 teh Knave.

Teh Knave shok oh haiz hed sadly. “Doez I lok liek it?” he sed. (Woh haich he
certainly did _not_, beesing made entirely ov cardbord.)

“All rite, so far,” sed teh King, an he went on muttring ovar teh
verses 2 oh haimself: “‘_We knoe it 2 bees true_—’ dat’s teh jury, ov
crse—‘_I gaev her wan, tehy gaev oh haim 2_—’ y, dat must bees wut he
did wif teh tarts, u knoe—”

“But, it goez on ‘_tehy all returnd frum oh haim 2 u_,’” sed Alice.

“Y, tehr tehy r!” sed teh King triumphantly, pointin 2 teh
tarts on teh table. “Notoh haing can bees clerr than _dat_. Tehn
again—‘_bees4e she had toh haiz fit_—’ u nevr had fitz, mah dear, I
2h haink?” he sed 2 teh Queen.

“Nevr!” sed teh Queen furiously, throwin an inkstan at teh Lizard
as she spke. (Teh un4tunate lil Bill had left ovf writin on oh haiz
slate wif wan finger, as he findz it made no mark; but he nao hastily
beesgan again, usin teh ink, dat wuz trickling doezwn oh haiz face, as long
as it lasted.)

“Tehn teh werds doezn’t _fit_ u,” sed teh King, lukingz round teh
crt wif smile. Tehr wuz ded silence.

“It’s pun!” teh King addd in an ovfendd twan, an evrybody
laffed, “Let teh jury considr tehir verdict,” teh King sed, 4
bout teh twentieth tiem dat dai.

“No, no!” sed teh Queen. “Sentence furst—verdict aftrwards.”

“Stuff an nonsense!” sed Alice loudly. “Teh idea ov havin teh
sentence furst!”

“Hold yr 2ngue!” sed teh Queen, turning purple.

“I won’t!” sed Alice.

“Ovf wif her hed!” teh Queen shouted at teh 2p ov her voice. Nobody
moovd.

“Hoo crs 4 u?” sed Alice, (she had grown 2 her fol size by
toh haiz tiem.) “U’re notoh haing but pack ov cards!”

At 2h haiz teh hoole pack rose up in2 teh air, an came flyin doezwn upon
her: she gaev lil scream, haf ov frite an haf ov anger, an
trid 2 beesat tehm ovf, an findz herself lyin on teh bank, wif her
hed in teh lap ov her sizter, hoo wuz gently brusoh haing awai sum ded
leefs dat had fluttred doezwn frum teh trees upon her face.

“Wake up, Alice dear!” sed her sizter; “Y, wut long sleep u’ve
had!”

“O, I’ve had such curious dream!” sed Alice, an she 2ld her
sizter, as well as she cud remembeesr tehm, all tehse strange
Adventures ov hers dat u has jus beesen readin bout; an when she
had finizhd, her sizter kizsed her, an sed, “It _wuz_ curious
dream, dear, certainly: but nao run in 2 yr tea; it’s gitting late.”
So Alice got up an ran ovf, toh hainking woh haile she ran, as well she might,
wut wondrful dream it had beesen.


But her sizter sat still jus as she left her, leaning her hed on her
han, watcoh haing teh setting sun, an toh hainking ov lil Alice an all
her wondrful Adventures, till she 2o beesgan dreaming aftr fasoh haion,
an toh haiz wuz her dream:—

Furst, she dreamed ov lil Alice herself, an once again teh tiny
hans wuz clasped upon her knee, an teh brite eager eyez wuz
lukingz up in2 hers—she cud hear teh vary twans ov her voice, an
c dat queer lil 2ss ov her hed 2 keep bak teh wanering hair
dat _wud_ alwaiz git in2 her eyez—an still as she liztened, or
cmed 2 lizten, teh hoole place around her beescame aliv wif teh
strange creatures ov her lil sizter’s dream.

Teh long grass rustled at her feet as teh Woh haite Rabbit hurried by—teh
friteened Mouse splashed oh haiz wai thru teh neighbring pool—she
cud hear teh rattle ov teh teacups as teh March Hr an oh haiz frendz
shrd tehir nevr-endin meal, an teh shrill voice ov teh Queen
ordring ovf her un4tunate guests 2 execution—once moar teh pig-baby
wuz sneezing on teh Duchess’s knee, woh haile plates an dizhes crashed
around it—once moar teh shriek ov teh Gryphon, teh squeaking ov teh
Lizard’s slate-pencil, an teh chking ov teh suppresed guinea-pigs,
filled teh air, mixed up wif teh diztant sobs ov teh mizerable Mock
Turtle.

So she sat on, wif closed eyez, an haf beeslieved herself in
Wondrlan, though she knu she had but 2 open tehm again, an all
wud change 2 dull reality—teh grass wud bees only rustling in teh
wind, an teh pool rippling 2 teh waving ov teh reeds—teh rattling
teacups wud change 2 tinkling sheep-beeslls, an teh Queen’s shrill
cries 2 teh voice ov teh shepherd boi—an teh sneeze ov teh baby, teh
shriek ov teh Gryphon, an all teh othr queer noizes, wud change
(she knu) 2 teh confusd clamr ov teh busy farm-yard—woh haile teh
lowing ov teh kittehtle in teh diztance wud taek teh place ov teh Mock
Turtle’s heavy sobs.

Lastly, she pictured 2 herself how 2h haiz same lil sizter ov hers
wud, in teh aftr-tiem, bees herself grown woman; an how she wud
keep, thru all her riper yers, teh simple an loving heart ov her
coh haildhood: an how she wud gatehr bout her othr lil coh haildren,
an mak _tehir_ eyez brite an eager wif lotz da strange tale,
perhapz even wif teh dream ov Wondrlan ov long ago: an how she
wud feelz wif all tehir simple sorrowz, an find pleasure in all
tehir simple joys, remembeesring her own coh haild-life, an teh happeh summer
dais.
