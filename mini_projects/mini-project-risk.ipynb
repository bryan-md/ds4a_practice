    "- There is an attacker and a defender.\n",
    "- The attacker rolls 3 dice if they have 3 or more units, 2 dice if they have 2 units, and 1 die if they only have 1 unit. <sup>1</sup>\n",
    "- The defender rolls 2 dice if they have 2 or more units, and 1 die if they only have 1 unit. <sup>2</sup>\n",
    "- All dice are standard 6-sided dice with an equal chance of rolling any number between 1 and 6, inclusive.\n",
    "- The attacker can choose to stop the battle at any time.<sup>3**</sup>\n",
    "- **Match the highest attacking die to the highest defending die - the side with the lower number loses a unit. The defender always wins ties. <sup>4</sup>**\n",
    "- **If both sides rolled a second die, match the second-highest attacking die to the second-highest defending die - the side with the lower number loses a unit. The defender always wins ties.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The python app needs to take three numbers as inputs:\n",
    "1. The number of attacking units\n",
    "2. The number of defending units\n",
    "3. The number of units the attacker is willing to lose before they call off the attack (**this can be equal to or less than the number of units they are attacking with)<sup>5</sup>**\n",
    "Then determine the outcome of the combat based on them. Your app should **simulate as many rounds of combat as needed<sup>6</sup>** **to reduce the number of defenders to 0 or the number of attackers to their pre-set threshold.**<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the expected output, we only need to know 2 things:\n",
    "1. The number of attackers remaining after the battle\n",
    "2. The number of defenders remaining after the battle <br>\n",
    "Of course, if there are 0 defenders remaining, we know the attacker won the battle! Likewise, if\n",

    "attacker give up.\n",
    "\n",
    " I personally was unsure if the attacker can choose to continue at the end of every round, or, if their 'pre-set' threshold. It seems that if the threshold wouldn't be necessary as an input if they can choose to stop at at a predetermined number. I have never played risk, so I'm probably not interpretting this correctly. For the purposes of this project, ***I have interpreted that selecting the 'number of people the attacker is willing to lose' as 'stopping the battle when they want'.***\n"
